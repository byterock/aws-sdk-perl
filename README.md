aws-sdk-perl
============

Attempt to build a complete AWS SDK in Perl

This project is attempting to build an entire AWS SDK from the information
that is stored in other AWS SDKs. Other AWS SDKs have a "data-driven" approach,
meaning that the definitions for the method calls are stored in a data structure
describing input and output parameters.

The project is actually generating all of it's classes from botocore

Project info:

Travis CI status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pplu/aws-sdk-perl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pplu/aws-sdk-perl)

Version on CPAN: [![CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/Paws.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pl/Paws)


Installation
============

If you want to install and use Paws then just install it via cpan, cpanm, carton or the likes. If you want to contribute code: read on

```
cpanm Paws
```

```
echo "requires 'Paws';" >> cpanfile
carton install

carton exec my_script_that_uses_paws
```

Development setup
============

If you want to develop a feature, or contribute code in some way, you need a development setup. This is done by cloning
the repo into a local directory.

```
# Clone the repo. For what it's worth, you can clone from a fork too :)
git clone https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl.git
cd aws-sdk-perl
```

With carton you can install all the dependencies needed in a local environment, so you can play around with dependencies without
affecting the system libraries. The cpanfile is used to track the dependencies needed.

It's possible that you need -dev libraries for compiling some of these modules. These packages are:

* In Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libssl-dev
```

* In Red Hat/CentOS:

```
sudo yum install libxml2-devel openssl-devel
```

* In Mac OS X:

```
brew install openssl
```

If yo are using Mac OS X - El Capitan(10.11) you will probably need to force the link of the openssl header to /usr/local:

```
brew link openssl --force
```

And now tell carton to install the dependecies in a local lib

```
carton install
# drop into a shell so perl can always find the local libraries
carton exec $SHELL -l
```

Now we'll pull the paws-maintained fork of boto (so we can generate the SDK)

```
make pull-other-sdks
```

Now we're ready to code away! Happy hacking.

Organization
============

builder-lib: Contains classes that convert the botocore definitions into perl classes.

auto-lib: Contains the auto-generated classes. Changes to code in this directory
will be overwritten, so only commit autogenerated code; never handwritten code (see "Generating API").

Changes that fix something in auto-lib are welcome, but cannot be applied directly, since they will be
overwritten. Usually, they indicate some kind of general problem with other APIs, so the
problem has to be fixed generically.

lib: Contains roles and classes that the auto-generated classes use to call the API,
sign requests, handle responses, etc.

Generating API
============

Note: This step is not necessary if you want to try out the SDK. We commit in "auto-lib"
the classes generated by the definitions to which the "botocore" submodule points to. If you're
not developing the SDK, go directly to the "Trying it out" step :)

Execute command make pull-other-sdks This will do a git pull of some official AWS sdks
that are data-driven, and used to generate the SDK.

If documentation-1.json is not present in botocore/botocore/data/ for each service,
which it will not when first using this project or when botocore possibly updates,
then you need to first run the command to generate links to the AWS docs with:
```
make docu-links
```
This will allow the following two commands to function.

To generate the API for a given API call:
```
./gen_classes.pl --classes botocore/botocore/data/SERVICE/DATE/service-2.json
```

This will generate file(s) in auto-lib.

To generate all the APIs:

```
make gen-classes
```

Perl versions
============

The SDK is targeted at modern Perl versions. Since a new perl gets released every year, distributions perl tend to lag behind, so
support for perl versions on any modern, widespread distribution is our target.
Very old versions may work, but no intention to support them is made. You can always install a modern version of perl with perlbrew or
plenv in a breeze. We're running the test cases on Travis for all "supported" perl versions. If you want to support a lower version,
you can contribute back. Acceptance of patches for older versions of Perl won't mean that the compatibility will be maintained
long-term, although it will be tried :).

Dependencies
============

Dependencies are versioned in a cpanfile. If you have carton, just execute 'carton install' in the sdk directory, and all dependencies
will be pulled in automatically into a local library path. After that use 'carton exec ...' to execute your scripts.

If you add a dependency, just add it to the cpanfile file. There are three sections:

 - the general section is for dependencies that are needed only in runtime
 - the test section is for dependecies needed to run the test suite
 - the develop section is for dependencies needed for developers

carton install installs all dependencies in all sections (after all, we're in developer mode here)

Packaging
============

Packaging is managed with Dist::Zilla. To install Dist::Zilla and the necessary plugins, run:

```
make dist
```

After this, you will have a tar.gz suitable for uploading to CPAN or to your own mini-CPAN

Releasing
============

The release process is as follows:

X.XX will be the version that you are currently working on (the one you want to release)
Y.YY will be the next version (which we start). This assumes `origin` as the main SDK source.

```
git checkout release/X.XX
git pull origin release/X.XX
```

Edit README.md to add any relevant contributions.

```
make gen-paws
```

Will copy the contents of the Contributions section of README.md into Paws.pm so that the same
section appears in CPAN also.

Now edit the `Changes` file to add the date of release, adjusting the entry for version X.XX to 
todays date.

Commit everything up till now and push

```
git push origin release/X.XX
```

Take a look at Travis pipelines to see if the branch you're going to release is green: https://travis-ci.org/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/branches

We don't want to ship Paws when it's failing it's tests.

If everything is OK:

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge release/X.XX
git push origin master
git tag release-X.XX
git push origin release-X.XX
make dist
```

this will generate Paws-X.XX.tar.gz, which is the artifact that is uploadable to CPAN

```
git checkout -b release/Y.YY
git push --set-upstream origin release/Y.YY
```

This creates the branch for working on the next release.

We bump the version number in the builder. Edit `builder-lib/Paws/API/Builder/Paws.pm`. Near line 12
we will find Paws version number. Replace X.XX for Y.YY

```

We add Y.YY to the Changes file. Commit the changes and push:

```
git push origin release/Y.YY
```

We're ready for developing Y.YY

After that: upload Paws-X.XX.tar.gz to CPAN an do a walk around issues and MRs that have
been fixed / merged in the release, notifying that "Paws X.XX has hit CPAN with this issue fixed"


Trying it out
============

Each class for each API can be constructed in the following way:

Create a Perl script (myscript.pl)

```
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Paws;
use Data::Printer;

my $iam = Paws->service('IAM');

my $summary = $iam->GetAccountSummary;
p $summary->SummaryMap;
```

also take a look at the CLI utility (see below) for fast testing)

Credentials
============

See MetaCPAN https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws#AUTHENTICATION

or

```
perldoc Paws
```

Status
================

Don't consider the SDK as "stable" code. There is a lot of experimenting going on. That said,
people are using it in production, so changes to the way you call APIs, although not guaranteed, are
not prone to change because they are autogenerated. Expect changes around the way you obtain
service classes, transmit credentials, etc. Look at the TODO for expected changes to come.

As of 2015-02 I'm documenting breaking changes in the Changes file. API changes that break stuff
will be documented there. Please read the Changes file before updating your git clone.

Using the SDK in your code
================

Although the code isn't considered stable yet, it works, and more than one person is using it
already. I recommend you to using a cpanfile, and bundling Paws with carton bundle

Supported AWS Services
================

Take a look at https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws#SUPPORTED-SERVICES

If a service is not supported, it will warn on construction with an explicit "non supported API"
message. Basically all query and json services are supported. RestXML and RestJSON services are in the coming.

Documentation
================
All services get auto-generated POD documentation. perldoc a file to take a look at the documentation.

CLI utility
================
Paws comes with a command-line utility to exercise the SDK. Just like Paws is the namespace
for the SDK, "paws" (in /script) is the cli utility. It's quite rudimentary, but think of it as
a quick way to try out calling services. Just call:

```
paws
```

to list all services. If a service isn't supported yet, it will die explicitly advising you that
Paws doesn't support that service yet.

```
paws EC2 --region eu-west-1 DescribeInstances
```

Parameters needed in for DescribeInstances can be passed as a list of parameters (see https://metacpan.org/pod/ARGV::Struct) for complete
documentation of how to pass parameters via command line.

```
paws EC2 --region eu-west-1 DescribeInstances Parameter1: ValueForParameter1 ListParameter: [ V1 V2 ] ComplexParam { Key1 Value1 Key2 Value 2 }
```
