=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::ListComponents - Arguments for method ListComponents on L<Paws::ImageBuilder>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListComponents on the
L<EC2 Image Builder|Paws::ImageBuilder> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListComponents.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListComponents.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $imagebuilder = Paws->service('ImageBuilder');
    my $ListComponentsResponse = $imagebuilder->ListComponents(
      Filters => [
        {
          Name => 'MyFilterName',                # OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyFilterValue', ... ],    # min: 1, max: 10; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                                         # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                           # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNonEmptyString',          # OPTIONAL
      Owner      => 'Self',                      # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ComponentVersionList = $ListComponentsResponse->ComponentVersionList;
    my $NextToken            = $ListComponentsResponse->NextToken;
    my $RequestId            = $ListComponentsResponse->RequestId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ImageBuilder::ListComponentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head2 NextToken => Str

A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken

customers.

Valid values are: C<"Self">, C<"Shared">, C<"Amazon">
