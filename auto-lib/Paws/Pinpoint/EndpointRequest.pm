=head1 NAME

Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Address => $value, ..., User => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Address

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the channel type and other settings for an endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Address => Str

The destination address for messages or push notifications that you
send to the endpoint. The address varies by channel. For a
push-notification channel, use the token provided by the push
notification service, such as an Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token.
For the SMS channel, use a phone number in E.164 format, such as
+12065550100. For the email channel, use an email address.


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::Pinpoint::MapOfListOf__string>

One or more custom attributes that describe the endpoint by associating
a name with an array of values. For example, the value of a custom
attribute named Interests might be: ["science", "music", "travel"]. You
can use these attributes as filter criteria when you create segments.

When you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using the
following characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?),
backslash (\), and slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console can't display
attribute names that contain these characters. This limitation doesn't
apply to attribute values.


=head2 ChannelType => Str

The channel to use when sending messages or push notifications to the
endpoint.


=head2 Demographic => L<Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointDemographic>

The demographic information for the endpoint, such as the time zone and
platform.


=head2 EffectiveDate => Str

The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint is updated.


=head2 EndpointStatus => Str

Specifies whether to send messages or push notifications to the
endpoint. Valid values are: ACTIVE, messages are sent to the endpoint;
and, INACTIVE, messages arenE<rsquo>t sent to the endpoint.

Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value to ACTIVE when you create
an endpoint or update an existing endpoint. Amazon Pinpoint
automatically sets this value to INACTIVE if you update another
endpoint that has the same address specified by the Address property.


=head2 Location => L<Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointLocation>

The geographic information for the endpoint.


=head2 Metrics => L<Paws::Pinpoint::MapOf__double>

One or more custom metrics that your app reports to Amazon Pinpoint for
the endpoint.


=head2 OptOut => Str

Specifies whether the user who's associated with the endpoint has opted
out of receiving messages and push notifications from you. Possible
values are: ALL, the user has opted out and doesn't want to receive any
messages or push notifications; and, NONE, the user hasn't opted out
and wants to receive all messages and push notifications.


=head2 RequestId => Str

The unique identifier for the most recent request to update the
endpoint.


=head2 User => L<Paws::Pinpoint::EndpointUser>

One or more custom user attributes that describe the user who's
associated with the endpoint.
