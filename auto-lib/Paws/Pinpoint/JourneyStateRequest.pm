Changes the status of a journey.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 State => Str

The status of the journey. Currently, the only supported value is
CANCELLED.

If you cancel a journey, Amazon Pinpoint continues to perform
activities that are currently in progress, until those activities are
complete. Amazon Pinpoint also continues to collect and aggregate
analytics data for those activities, until they are complete, and any
activities that were complete when you cancelled the journey.

After you cancel a journey, you can't add, change, or remove any
activities from the journey. In addition, Amazon Pinpoint stops
evaluating the journey and doesn't perform any activities that haven't
started.
