=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CampaignHook => L<Paws::Pinpoint::CampaignHook>

The settings for the AWS Lambda function to use by default as a code
hook for campaigns in the application. To override these settings for a

campaign.

Quiet time is a specific time range when messages aren't sent to
endpoints, if all the following conditions are met:

=over

=item *

The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of the endpoint is set to a
valid value.

=item *

The current time in the endpoint's time zone is later than or equal to
the time specified by the QuietTime.Start property for the application
(or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings).

=item *

The current time in the endpoint's time zone is earlier than or equal
to the time specified by the QuietTime.End property for the application
(or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings).

If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the endpoint will receive
messages from a campaign or journey, even if quiet time is enabled.

To override the default quiet time settings for a specific campaign or
journey, use the

Campaign resource or the Journey resource to define a custom quiet time
for the campaign or journey.
