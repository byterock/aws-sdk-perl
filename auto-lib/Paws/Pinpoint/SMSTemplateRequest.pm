  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Body => $value, ..., TemplateDescription => $value  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Body => Str

The message body to use in text messages that are based on the message
template.


=head2 DefaultSubstitutions => Str

A JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message
variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value
pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The
corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When
you create a message that's based on the template, you can override
these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and
values.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Pinpoint::MapOf__string>

A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to
associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required
tag key and an associated tag value.


=head2 TemplateDescription => Str

A custom description of the message template.
