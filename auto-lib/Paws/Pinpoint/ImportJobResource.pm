=head1 NAME

Paws::Pinpoint::ImportJobResource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pinpoint::ImportJobResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefineSegment => $value, ..., SegmentName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pinpoint::ImportJobResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefineSegment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the resource settings for a job that imports
endpoint definitions from one or more files. The files can be stored in
an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or uploaded
directly from a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DefineSegment => Bool

Specifies whether the import job creates a segment that contains the
endpoints, when the endpoint definitions are imported.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

(Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you assigned to an external ID
key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint previously used this value
to assume an IAM role when importing endpoint definitions, but we
removed this requirement. We don't recommend use of external IDs for
IAM roles that are assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Format => Str

The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions to
import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma-separated values format; and,
JSON, for newline-delimited JSON format.

If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that location
contains multiple files that use different formats, Amazon Pinpoint
imports data only from the files that use the specified format.


=head2 RegisterEndpoints => Bool

Specifies whether the import job registers the endpoints with Amazon
Pinpoint, when the endpoint definitions are imported.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to access the
Amazon S3 location to import endpoint definitions from.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Url => Str

The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a
folder or a single file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint
imports endpoint definitions from the files in this location, including
any subfolders that the folder contains.

The URL should be in the following format:
s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can end with the
key for an individual object or a prefix that qualifies multiple
objects.


=head2 SegmentId => Str

The identifier for the segment that the import job updates or adds
endpoint definitions to, if the import job updates an existing segment.


=head2 SegmentName => Str

The custom name for the segment that's created by the import job, if
the value of the DefineSegment property is true.
