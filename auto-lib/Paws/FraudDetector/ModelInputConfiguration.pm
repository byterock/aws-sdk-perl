=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::ModelInputConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::ModelInputConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CsvInputTemplate => $value, ..., JsonInputTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::ModelInputConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CsvInputTemplate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The model input configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CsvInputTemplate => Str

Template for constructing the CSV input-data sent to SageMaker. At
event-evaluation, the placeholders for variable-names in the template
will be replaced with the variable values before being sent to
SageMaker.


=head2 Format => Str

The format of the model input configuration. The format differs
depending on if it is passed through to SageMaker or constructed by
Amazon Fraud Detector.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IsOpaque => Bool

For an opaque-model, the input to the model will be a ByteBuffer blob
provided in the getPrediction request, and will be passed to SageMaker
as-is. For non-opaque models, the input will be constructed by Amazon
Fraud Detector based on the model-configuration.


=head2 JsonInputTemplate => Str

Template for constructing the JSON input-data sent to SageMaker. At
event-evaluation, the placeholders for variable names in the template
will be replaced with the variable values before being sent to
SageMaker.
