=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::SSESpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::SSESpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., SSEType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::SSESpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Enabled => Bool

Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an AWS managed
CMK or an AWS owned CMK. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type
is set to C<KMS> and an AWS managed CMK is used (AWS KMS charges
apply). If disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is
set to AWS owned CMK.


=head2 KMSMasterKeyId => Str

The AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that should be used for the AWS
KMS encryption. To specify a CMK, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name
(ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide this
parameter if the key is different from the default DynamoDB customer
master key alias/aws/dynamodb.


=head2 SSEType => Str

Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

=over

=item *

C<KMS> - Server-side encryption that uses AWS Key Management Service.
The key is stored in your account and is managed by AWS KMS (AWS KMS
charges apply).
