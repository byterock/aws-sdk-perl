=head1 NAME

Paws::AppMesh::VirtualNodeSpec

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppMesh::VirtualNodeSpec object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Backends => $value, ..., ServiceDiscovery => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppMesh::VirtualNodeSpec object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Backends

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the specification of a virtual node.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Backends => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppMesh::Backend>]

The backends that the virtual node is expected to send outbound traffic
to.


=head2 Listeners => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppMesh::Listener>]

The listeners that the virtual node is expected to receive inbound
traffic from. You can specify one listener.


=head2 Logging => L<Paws::AppMesh::Logging>

The inbound and outbound access logging information for the virtual
node.


=head2 ServiceDiscovery => L<Paws::AppMesh::ServiceDiscovery>

The service discovery information for the virtual node. If your virtual
node does not expect ingress traffic, you can omit this parameter.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::AppMesh>
