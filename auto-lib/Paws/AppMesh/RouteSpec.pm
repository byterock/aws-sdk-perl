=head1 NAME

Paws::AppMesh::RouteSpec

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppMesh::RouteSpec object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GrpcRoute => $value, ..., TcpRoute => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppMesh::RouteSpec object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GrpcRoute

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents a route specification. Specify one route
type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GrpcRoute => L<Paws::AppMesh::GrpcRoute>

An object that represents the specification of a GRPC route.


=head2 Http2Route => L<Paws::AppMesh::HttpRoute>

An object that represents the specification of an HTTP2 route.


=head2 HttpRoute => L<Paws::AppMesh::HttpRoute>

An object that represents the specification of an HTTP route.


=head2 Priority => Int

The priority for the route. Routes are matched based on the specified
value, where 0 is the highest priority.


=head2 TcpRoute => L<Paws::AppMesh::TcpRoute>
