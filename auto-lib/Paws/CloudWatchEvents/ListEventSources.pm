=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchEvents::ListEventSources - Arguments for method ListEventSources on L<Paws::CloudWatchEvents>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListEventSources on the
L<Amazon EventBridge|Paws::CloudWatchEvents> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListEventSources.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListEventSources.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $events = Paws->service('CloudWatchEvents');
    my $ListEventSourcesResponse = $events->ListEventSources(
      Limit      => 1,                            # OPTIONAL
      NamePrefix => 'MyEventSourceNamePrefix',    # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',                # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $EventSources = $ListEventSourcesResponse->EventSources;
    my $NextToken    = $ListEventSourcesResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudWatchEvents::ListEventSourcesResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/events/ListEventSources>

=head2 NamePrefix => Str

Specifying this limits the results to only those partner event sources
with names that start with the specified prefix.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the next set of
results.
