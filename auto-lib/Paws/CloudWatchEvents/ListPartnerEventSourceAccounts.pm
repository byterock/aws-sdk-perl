    my $events = Paws->service('CloudWatchEvents');
    my $ListPartnerEventSourceAccountsResponse =
      $events->ListPartnerEventSourceAccounts(
      EventSourceName => 'MyEventSourceName',
      Limit           => 1,                     # OPTIONAL
      NextToken       => 'MyNextToken',         # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken = $ListPartnerEventSourceAccountsResponse->NextToken;
    my $PartnerEventSourceAccounts =
      $ListPartnerEventSourceAccountsResponse->PartnerEventSourceAccounts;

# Returns a L<Paws::CloudWatchEvents::ListPartnerEventSourceAccountsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
