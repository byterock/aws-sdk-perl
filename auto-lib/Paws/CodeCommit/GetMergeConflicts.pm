=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeCommit::GetMergeConflicts - Arguments for method GetMergeConflicts on L<Paws::CodeCommit>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetMergeConflicts on the
L<AWS CodeCommit|Paws::CodeCommit> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetMergeConflicts.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetMergeConflicts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codecommit = Paws->service('CodeCommit');
    my $GetMergeConflictsOutput = $codecommit->GetMergeConflicts(
      DestinationCommitSpecifier => 'MyCommitName',
      MergeOption                => 'FAST_FORWARD_MERGE',
      RepositoryName             => 'MyRepositoryName',
      SourceCommitSpecifier      => 'MyCommitName',
      ConflictDetailLevel        => 'FILE_LEVEL',           # OPTIONAL
      ConflictResolutionStrategy => 'NONE',                 # OPTIONAL
      MaxConflictFiles           => 1,                      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken                  => 'MyNextToken',          # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $BaseCommitId         = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->BaseCommitId;
    my $ConflictMetadataList = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->ConflictMetadataList;
    my $DestinationCommitId  = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->DestinationCommitId;
    my $Mergeable            = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->Mergeable;
    my $NextToken            = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->NextToken;
    my $SourceCommitId       = $GetMergeConflictsOutput->SourceCommitId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeCommit::GetMergeConflictsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codecommit/GetMergeConflicts>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConflictDetailLevel => Str

The level of conflict detail to use. If unspecified, the default
FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches
has differences on the same line.

Valid values are: C<"FILE_LEVEL">, C<"LINE_LEVEL">

=head2 ConflictResolutionStrategy => Str

Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to
attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is
NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the
merge operation is successful.

Valid values are: C<"NONE">, C<"ACCEPT_SOURCE">, C<"ACCEPT_DESTINATION">, C<"AUTOMERGE">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationCommitSpecifier => Str

The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).



=head2 MaxConflictFiles => Int

The maximum number of files to include in the output.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MergeOption => Str

The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code.

Valid values are: C<"FAST_FORWARD_MERGE">, C<"SQUASH_MERGE">, C<"THREE_WAY_MERGE">

=head2 NextToken => Str

An enumeration token that, when provided in a request, returns the next
batch of the results.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RepositoryName => Str

The name of the repository where the pull request was created.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceCommitSpecifier => Str

The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).
