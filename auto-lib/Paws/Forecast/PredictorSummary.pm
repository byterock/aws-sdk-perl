=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::PredictorSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::PredictorSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::PredictorSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a summary of the predictor properties that are used in the
ListPredictors operation. To get the complete set of properties, call
the DescribePredictor operation, and provide the listed
C<PredictorArn>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

When the model training task was created.


=head2 DatasetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that contains the
data used to train the predictor.


=head2 LastModificationTime => Str

Initially, the same as C<CreationTime> (status is C<CREATE_PENDING>).
Updated when training starts (status changed to C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS>),
and when training is complete (status changed to C<ACTIVE>) or fails
(status changed to C<CREATE_FAILED>).


=head2 Message => Str

If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.


=head2 PredictorArn => Str

The ARN of the predictor.


=head2 PredictorName => Str

The name of the predictor.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the predictor. States include:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE>

=item *

C<CREATE_PENDING>, C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<CREATE_FAILED>

=item *

C<DELETE_PENDING>, C<DELETE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<DELETE_FAILED>

=item *

C<UPDATE_PENDING>, C<UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<UPDATE_FAILED>

=back

The C<Status> of the predictor must be C<ACTIVE> before you can use the
predictor to create a forecast.
