This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::S3Config object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KMSKeyArn => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::S3Config object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KMSKeyArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The path to the file(s) in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
bucket, and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
Amazon Forecast can assume to access the file(s). Optionally, includes
an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key. This object is part of the
DataSource object that is submitted in the CreateDatasetImportJob
request, and part of the DataDestination object that is submitted in
the CreateForecastExportJob request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Path => Str

The path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or
file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If
you provide a value for the C<KMSKeyArn> key, the role must allow
