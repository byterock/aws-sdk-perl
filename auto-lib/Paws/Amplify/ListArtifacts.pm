=head1 NAME

Paws::Amplify::ListArtifacts - Arguments for method ListArtifacts on L<Paws::Amplify>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListArtifacts on the
L<AWS Amplify|Paws::Amplify> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListArtifacts.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListArtifacts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $amplify = Paws->service('Amplify');
    my $ListArtifactsResult = $amplify->ListArtifacts(
      AppId      => 'MyAppId',
      BranchName => 'MyBranchName',
      JobId      => 'MyJobId',
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Artifacts = $ListArtifactsResult->Artifacts;
    my $NextToken = $ListArtifactsResult->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Amplify::ListArtifactsResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/amplify/ListArtifacts>
