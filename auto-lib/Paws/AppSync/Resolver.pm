=head1 NAME

Paws::AppSync::Resolver

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppSync::Resolver object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CachingConfig => $value, ..., TypeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppSync::Resolver object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CachingConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a resolver.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CachingConfig => L<Paws::AppSync::CachingConfig>

The caching configuration for the resolver.


=head2 DataSourceName => Str

The resolver data source name.


=head2 FieldName => Str

The resolver field name.


=head2 Kind => Str

The resolver type.

=over

=item *

B<UNIT>: A UNIT resolver type. A UNIT resolver is the default resolver
type. A UNIT resolver enables you to execute a GraphQL query against a
single data source.

=item *

B<PIPELINE>: A PIPELINE resolver type. A PIPELINE resolver enables you
to execute a series of C<Function> in a serial manner. You can use a
pipeline resolver to execute a GraphQL query against multiple data
sources.

=back



=head2 PipelineConfig => L<Paws::AppSync::PipelineConfig>

The C<PipelineConfig>.


=head2 RequestMappingTemplate => Str

The request mapping template.


=head2 ResolverArn => Str

The resolver ARN.


=head2 ResponseMappingTemplate => Str

The response mapping template.


=head2 SyncConfig => L<Paws::AppSync::SyncConfig>

The C<SyncConfig> for a resolver attached to a versioned datasource.


=head2 TypeName => Str

The resolver type name.
