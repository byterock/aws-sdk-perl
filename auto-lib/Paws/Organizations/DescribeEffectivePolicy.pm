=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeEffectivePolicy on the

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $organizations = Paws->service('Organizations');

      $organizations->DescribeEffectivePolicy(
      PolicyType => 'TAG_POLICY',
      TargetId   => 'MyPolicyTargetId',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
