      AccountName            => 'MyAccountName',
      Email                  => 'MyEmail',
      IamUserAccessToBilling => 'ALLOW',           # OPTIONAL
      RoleName               => 'MyRoleName',      # OPTIONAL
    );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccountName => Str

The friendly name of the member account.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Email => Str

The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account in
the commercial Region. This email address must not already be
associated with another AWS account. You must use a valid email address
to complete account creation. You can't access the root user of the
account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email
address. Like all request parameters for C<CreateGovCloudAccount>, the
request for the email address for the AWS GovCloud (US) account
originates from the commercial Region. It does not come from the AWS
GovCloud (US) Region.



=head2 IamUserAccessToBilling => Str

If set to C<ALLOW>, the new linked account in the commercial Region
enables IAM users to access account billing information I<if> they have
the required permissions. If set to C<DENY>, only the root user of the
new account can access account billing information. For more
information, see Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management
Console
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate)
in the I<AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.>

If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to C<ALLOW>,
and IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access
billing information for the new account.

Valid values are: C<"ALLOW">, C<"DENY">

=head2 RoleName => Str

(Optional)

The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically
preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the master
account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as
permitted by the master account administrator. The role has
administrator permissions in the new member account.

If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
C<OrganizationAccountAccessRole>.

For more information about how to use this role to access the member
account, see Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your
Organization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role)
in the I<AWS Organizations User Guide>. See also steps 2 and 3 in
Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html)
in the I<IAM User Guide.>

The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to
validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following
characters: =,.@-
