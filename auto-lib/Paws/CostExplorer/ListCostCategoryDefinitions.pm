=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::ListCostCategoryDefinitions - Arguments for method ListCostCategoryDefinitions on L<Paws::CostExplorer>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListCostCategoryDefinitions on the
L<AWS Cost Explorer Service|Paws::CostExplorer> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListCostCategoryDefinitions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListCostCategoryDefinitions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ce = Paws->service('CostExplorer');
    my $ListCostCategoryDefinitionsResponse = $ce->ListCostCategoryDefinitions(
      EffectiveOn => 'MyZonedDateTime',    # OPTIONAL
      NextToken   => 'MyNextPageToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CostCategoryReferences =
      $ListCostCategoryDefinitionsResponse->CostCategoryReferences;
    my $NextToken = $ListCostCategoryDefinitionsResponse->NextToken;

  # Returns a L<Paws::CostExplorer::ListCostCategoryDefinitionsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ce/ListCostCategoryDefinitions>
