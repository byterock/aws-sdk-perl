=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::GetUsageForecast - Arguments for method GetUsageForecast on L<Paws::CostExplorer>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetUsageForecast on the
L<AWS Cost Explorer Service|Paws::CostExplorer> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetUsageForecast.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetUsageForecast.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ce = Paws->service('CostExplorer');
    my $GetUsageForecastResponse = $ce->GetUsageForecast(
      Granularity => 'DAILY',
      Metric      => 'BLENDED_COST',
      TimePeriod  => {
        End   => 'MyYearMonthDay',
        Start => 'MyYearMonthDay',

      },
      Filter => {
        And => [ <Expression>, ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        CostCategories => {
          Key => 'MyCostCategoryName',     # min: 1, max: 255; OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
        Dimensions => {
          Key => 'AZ'
          , # values: AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PURCHASE_TYPE, REGION, SERVICE, USAGE_TYPE, USAGE_TYPE_GROUP, RECORD_TYPE, OPERATING_SYSTEM, TENANCY, SCOPE, PLATFORM, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, DEPLOYMENT_OPTION, DATABASE_ENGINE, CACHE_ENGINE, INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY, BILLING_ENTITY, RESERVATION_ID, RESOURCE_ID, RIGHTSIZING_TYPE, SAVINGS_PLANS_TYPE, SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN, PAYMENT_OPTION; OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
        Not  => <Expression>,
        Or   => [ <Expression>, ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        Tags => {
          Key => 'MyTagKey',               # OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      PredictionIntervalLevel => 1,    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ForecastResultsByTime =
      $GetUsageForecastResponse->ForecastResultsByTime;
    my $Total = $GetUsageForecastResponse->Total;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CostExplorer::GetUsageForecastResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::CostExplorer::Expression>

The filters that you want to use to filter your forecast. Cost Explorer
API supports all of the Cost Explorer filters.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Granularity => Str

How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get 3 months of
C<DAILY> forecasts or 12 months of C<MONTHLY> forecasts.

The C<GetUsageForecast> operation supports only C<DAILY> and C<MONTHLY>
granularities.

Valid values are: C<"DAILY">, C<"MONTHLY">, C<"HOURLY">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metric => Str

Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast.

Valid values for a C<GetUsageForecast> call are the following:

=over

=item *

USAGE_QUANTITY

=item *

NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT

=back


Valid values are: C<"BLENDED_COST">, C<"UNBLENDED_COST">, C<"AMORTIZED_COST">, C<"NET_UNBLENDED_COST">, C<"NET_AMORTIZED_COST">, C<"USAGE_QUANTITY">, C<"NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT">

=head2 PredictionIntervalLevel => Int

Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You
can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a
confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident
Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction
interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction
intervals.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimePeriod => L<Paws::CostExplorer::DateInterval>

The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve usage
forecast for. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is
exclusive. For example, if C<start> is C<2017-01-01> and C<end> is
C<2017-05-01>, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from
C<2017-01-01> up to and including C<2017-04-30> but not including
C<2017-05-01>.
