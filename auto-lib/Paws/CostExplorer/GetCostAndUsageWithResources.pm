=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::GetCostAndUsageWithResources - Arguments for method GetCostAndUsageWithResources on L<Paws::CostExplorer>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetCostAndUsageWithResources on the
L<AWS Cost Explorer Service|Paws::CostExplorer> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetCostAndUsageWithResources.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetCostAndUsageWithResources.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ce = Paws->service('CostExplorer');
    my $GetCostAndUsageWithResourcesResponse =
      $ce->GetCostAndUsageWithResources(
      TimePeriod => {
        End   => 'MyYearMonthDay',
        Start => 'MyYearMonthDay',

      },
      Filter => {
        And => [ <Expression>, ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        CostCategories => {
          Key => 'MyCostCategoryName',     # min: 1, max: 255; OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
        Dimensions => {
          Key => 'AZ'
          , # values: AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PURCHASE_TYPE, REGION, SERVICE, USAGE_TYPE, USAGE_TYPE_GROUP, RECORD_TYPE, OPERATING_SYSTEM, TENANCY, SCOPE, PLATFORM, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, DEPLOYMENT_OPTION, DATABASE_ENGINE, CACHE_ENGINE, INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY, BILLING_ENTITY, RESERVATION_ID, RESOURCE_ID, RIGHTSIZING_TYPE, SAVINGS_PLANS_TYPE, SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN, PAYMENT_OPTION; OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
        Not  => <Expression>,
        Or   => [ <Expression>, ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        Tags => {
          Key => 'MyTagKey',               # OPTIONAL
          Values => [ 'MyValue', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Granularity => 'DAILY',    # OPTIONAL
      GroupBy     => [
        {
          Key => 'MyGroupDefinitionKey',    # OPTIONAL
          Type => 'DIMENSION', # values: DIMENSION, TAG, COST_CATEGORY; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                       # OPTIONAL
      Metrics => [ 'MyMetricName', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
      NextPageToken => 'MyNextPageToken',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $GroupDefinitions =
      $GetCostAndUsageWithResourcesResponse->GroupDefinitions;
    my $NextPageToken = $GetCostAndUsageWithResourcesResponse->NextPageToken;
    my $ResultsByTime = $GetCostAndUsageWithResourcesResponse->ResultsByTime;

 # Returns a L<Paws::CostExplorer::GetCostAndUsageWithResourcesResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::CostExplorer::Expression>

Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For example,
you can specify C<SERVICE> and C<LINKED_ACCOUNT> and get the costs that
are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest
C<Expression> objects to define any combination of dimension filters.
For more information, see Expression
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html).

The C<GetCostAndUsageWithResources> operation requires that you either
group by or filter by a C<ResourceId>.



=head2 Granularity => Str

Sets the AWS cost granularity to C<MONTHLY>, C<DAILY>, or C<HOURLY>. If
C<Granularity> isn't set, the response object doesn't include the
C<Granularity>, C<MONTHLY>, C<DAILY>, or C<HOURLY>.

Valid values are: C<"DAILY">, C<"MONTHLY">, C<"HOURLY">

=head2 GroupBy => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CostExplorer::GroupDefinition>]

You can group Amazon Web Services costs using up to two different
groups: either dimensions, tag keys, or both.



=head2 Metrics => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about
blended and unblended rates, see Why does the "blended" annotation
appear on some line items in my bill?
(https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/).

Valid values are C<AmortizedCost>, C<BlendedCost>, C<NetAmortizedCost>,
C<NetUnblendedCost>, C<NormalizedUsageAmount>, C<UnblendedCost>, and
C<UsageQuantity>.

If you return the C<UsageQuantity> metric, the service aggregates all
usage numbers without taking the units into account. For example, if
you aggregate C<usageQuantity> across all of Amazon EC2, the results
aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer
are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get
more meaningful C<UsageQuantity> metrics, filter by C<UsageType> or
C<UsageTypeGroups>.

C<Metrics> is required for C<GetCostAndUsageWithResources> requests.



=head2 NextPageToken => Str

The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token
when the response from a previous call has more results than the
maximum page size.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimePeriod => L<Paws::CostExplorer::DateInterval>

Sets the start and end dates for retrieving Amazon Web Services costs.
The range must be within the last 14 days (the start date cannot be
earlier than 14 days ago). The start date is inclusive, but the end
date is exclusive. For example, if C<start> is C<2017-01-01> and C<end>
is C<2017-05-01>, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from
C<2017-01-01> up to and including C<2017-04-30> but not including
C<2017-05-01>.
