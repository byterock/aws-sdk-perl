=head1 NAME

Paws::Budgets::Budget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Budgets::Budget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BudgetLimit => $value, ..., TimeUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Budgets::Budget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BudgetLimit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the output of the C<CreateBudget> operation. The content
consists of the detailed metadata and data file information, and the
current status of the C<budget> object.

This is the ARN pattern for a budget:

C<arn:aws:budgetservice::AccountId:budget/budgetName>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BudgetLimit => L<Paws::Budgets::Spend>

The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings
Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track
with your budget.

C<BudgetLimit> is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for
RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings
Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to C<100>, which is the
only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage
budgets. You can't use C<BudgetLimit> with C<PlannedBudgetLimits> for
C<CreateBudget> and C<UpdateBudget> actions.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BudgetName => Str

The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The
C<:> and C<\> characters aren't allowed in C<BudgetName>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BudgetType => Str

Whether this budget tracks costs, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage,
Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage.


=head2 CalculatedSpend => L<Paws::Budgets::CalculatedSpend>

The actual and forecasted cost or usage that the budget tracks.


=head2 CostFilters => L<Paws::Budgets::CostFilters>

The cost filters, such as service or tag, that are applied to a budget.

AWS Budgets supports the following services as a filter for RI budgets:

=over

=item *

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute

=item *

Amazon Redshift

=item *

Amazon Relational Database Service

=item *

Amazon ElastiCache

=item *

Amazon Elasticsearch Service

=back



=head2 CostTypes => L<Paws::Budgets::CostTypes>

The types of costs that are included in this C<COST> budget.

C<USAGE>, C<RI_UTILIZATION>, C<RI_COVERAGE>,
C<Savings_Plans_Utilization>, and C<Savings_Plans_Coverage> budgets do
not have C<CostTypes>.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The last time that you updated this budget.


=head2 PlannedBudgetLimits => L<Paws::Budgets::PlannedBudgetLimits>

A map containing multiple C<BudgetLimit>, including current or future
limits.

C<PlannedBudgetLimits> is available for cost or usage budget and
supports monthly and quarterly C<TimeUnit>.

For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of C<PlannedBudgetLimits>
values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11
months. The C<key> is the start of the month, C<UTC> in epoch seconds.

For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of C<PlannedBudgetLimits>
value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start
from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The C<key> is
the start of the quarter, C<UTC> in epoch seconds.

If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4
quarters for quarterly, provide the C<PlannedBudgetLimits> values only
for the remaining periods.

If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide
C<PlannedBudgetLimits> values from the start date of the budget.

After all of the C<BudgetLimit> values in C<PlannedBudgetLimits> are
used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the C<BudgetLimit>.
At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a
fixed budget.

C<DescribeBudget> and C<DescribeBudgets> response along with
C<PlannedBudgetLimits> will also contain C<BudgetLimit> representing
the current month or quarter limit present in C<PlannedBudgetLimits>.
This only applies to budgets created with C<PlannedBudgetLimits>.
Budgets created without C<PlannedBudgetLimits> will only contain
C<BudgetLimit>, and no C<PlannedBudgetLimits>.


=head2 TimePeriod => L<Paws::Budgets::TimePeriod>

The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start
date and an end date. The start date must come before the end date. The
end date must come before C<06/15/87 00:00 UTC>.

If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults
to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or
ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018,
chose C<DAILY>, and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to
C<01/24/18 00:00 UTC>. If you chose C<MONTHLY>, AWS set your start date
to C<01/01/18 00:00 UTC>. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set
your end date to C<06/15/87 00:00 UTC>. The defaults are the same for
the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

You can change either date with the C<UpdateBudget> operation.

After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
notifications and subscribers.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeUnit => Str

The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted
spend. C<DAILY> is available only for C<RI_UTILIZATION>,
C<RI_COVERAGE>, C<Savings_Plans_Utilization>, and
C<Savings_Plans_Coverage> budgets.
