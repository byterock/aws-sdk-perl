=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $transcribe = Paws->service('Transcribe');
    my $CreateVocabularyFilterResponse = $transcribe->CreateVocabularyFilter(
      LanguageCode            => 'en-US',
      VocabularyFilterName    => 'MyVocabularyFilterName',
      VocabularyFilterFileUri => 'MyUri',                    # OPTIONAL
      Words                   => [
        'MyWord', ...                                        # min: 1, max: 256
      ],                                                     # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LanguageCode     = $CreateVocabularyFilterResponse->LanguageCode;
    my $LastModifiedTime = $CreateVocabularyFilterResponse->LastModifiedTime;
    my $VocabularyFilterName =
      $CreateVocabularyFilterResponse->VocabularyFilterName;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Transcribe::CreateVocabularyFilterResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
