=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::CreateLocationEfs - Arguments for method CreateLocationEfs on L<Paws::Datasync>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateLocationEfs on the
L<AWS DataSync|Paws::Datasync> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateLocationEfs.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateLocationEfs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $datasync = Paws->service('Datasync');
    my $CreateLocationEfsResponse = $datasync->CreateLocationEfs(
      Ec2Config => {
        SecurityGroupArns => [
          'MyEc2SecurityGroupArn', ...    # max: 128
        ],                                # min: 1, max: 5
        SubnetArn => 'MyEc2SubnetArn',    # max: 128

      },
      EfsFilesystemArn => 'MyEfsFilesystemArn',
      Subdirectory     => 'MyEfsSubdirectory',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags             => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',                    # min: 1, max: 256
          Value => 'MyTagValue',                  # min: 1, max: 256; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                                          # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LocationArn = $CreateLocationEfsResponse->LocationArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Datasync::CreateLocationEfsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Ec2Config => L<Paws::Datasync::Ec2Config>

The subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses. The
security group that you provide needs to be able to communicate with
the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified.

The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target)
and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this
stage) is as follows:

=over

=item *

Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow
inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS
port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound connections
either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

=item *

Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a
rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the
file systemE<rsquo>s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections
either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security
Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the I<Amazon EFS
User Guide.>

=back




=head2 B<REQUIRED> EfsFilesystemArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon EFS file system.



=head2 Subdirectory => Str

A subdirectory in the locationE<rsquo>s path. This subdirectory in the
EFS file system is used to read data from the EFS source location or
write data to the EFS destination. By default, AWS DataSync uses the
root directory.

C<Subdirectory> must be specified with forward slashes. For example
C</path/to/folder>.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Datasync::TagListEntry>]

The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
resource. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you
manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
create a name tag for your location.
