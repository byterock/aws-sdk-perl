=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $datasync = Paws->service('Datasync');
    my $CreateLocationFsxWindowsResponse = $datasync->CreateLocationFsxWindows(
      FsxFilesystemArn  => 'MyFsxFilesystemArn',
      Password          => 'MySmbPassword',
      SecurityGroupArns => [
        'MyEc2SecurityGroupArn', ...    # max: 128
      ],
      User         => 'MySmbUser',
      Domain       => 'MySmbDomain',                 # OPTIONAL
      Subdirectory => 'MyFsxWindowsSubdirectory',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags         => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 256
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # min: 1, max: 256; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LocationArn = $CreateLocationFsxWindowsResponse->LocationArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Datasync::CreateLocationFsxWindowsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
