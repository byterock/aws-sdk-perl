Paws::SNS::CreateTopic - Arguments for method CreateTopic on L<Paws::SNS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateTopic on the
L<Amazon Simple Notification Service|Paws::SNS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateTopic.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateTopic.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sns = Paws->service('SNS');
    my $CreateTopicResponse = $sns->CreateTopic(
      Name       => 'MytopicName',
      Attributes => { 'MyattributeName' => 'MyattributeValue', },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags       => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],                            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $TopicArn = $CreateTopicResponse->TopicArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SNS::CreateTopicResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
