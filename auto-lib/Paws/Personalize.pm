=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize - Perl Interface to AWS Amazon Personalize

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Paws;

  my $obj = Paws->service('Personalize');
  my $res = $obj->Method(
    Arg1 => $val1,
    Arg2 => [ 'V1', 'V2' ],
    # if Arg3 is an object, the HashRef will be used as arguments to the constructor
    # of the arguments type
    Arg3 => { Att1 => 'Val1' },
    # if Arg4 is an array of objects, the HashRefs will be passed as arguments to
    # the constructor of the arguments type
    Arg4 => [ { Att1 => 'Val1'  }, { Att1 => 'Val2' } ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service that makes it easy to
add individualized recommendations to customers.

For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/personalize-2018-05-22>


=head1 METHODS

=head2 CreateBatchInferenceJob

=over

=item JobInput => L<Paws::Personalize::BatchInferenceJobInput>

=item JobName => Str

=item JobOutput => L<Paws::Personalize::BatchInferenceJobOutput>

=item RoleArn => Str

=item SolutionVersionArn => Str

=item [NumResults => Int]


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateBatchInferenceJob>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateBatchInferenceJobResponse> instance

Creates a batch inference job. The operation can handle up to 50
million records and the input file must be in JSON format. For more
information, see recommendations-batch.


=head2 CreateCampaign

=over

=item MinProvisionedTPS => Int

=item Name => Str

=item SolutionVersionArn => Str


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateCampaign>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateCampaignResponse> instance

Creates a campaign by deploying a solution version. When a client calls
the GetRecommendations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html)
and GetPersonalizedRanking
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html)
APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.

B<Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling>

A transaction is a single C<GetRecommendations> or
C<GetPersonalizedRanking> call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the
throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum
provisioned TPS (C<minProvisionedTPS>) specifies the baseline
throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum
billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond C<minProvisionedTPS>,
Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down,
but never below C<minProvisionedTPS>, to maintain a 70% utilization.
There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might
cause loss of transactions. It's recommended to start with a low
C<minProvisionedTPS>, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics,
and then increase the C<minProvisionedTPS> as necessary.

B<Status>

A campaign can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING E<gt> DELETE IN_PROGRESS

=back

To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.

Wait until the C<status> of the campaign is C<ACTIVE> before asking the
campaign for recommendations.

=head2 CreateDataset

=over

=item DatasetGroupArn => Str

=item DatasetType => Str

=item Name => Str

=item SchemaArn => Str


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDataset>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDatasetResponse> instance

Creates an empty dataset and adds it to the specified dataset group.
Use CreateDatasetImportJob to import your training data to a dataset.

There are three types of datasets:

=over

=item *

Interactions

=item *

Items

=item *

Users

=back

Each dataset type has an associated schema with required field types.
Only the C<Interactions> dataset is required in order to train a model
(also referred to as creating a solution).

A dataset can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING E<gt> DELETE IN_PROGRESS

=back

To get the status of the dataset, call DescribeDataset.

=head2 CreateDatasetGroup

=over

=item Name => Str

=item [KmsKeyArn => Str]

=item [RoleArn => Str]


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDatasetGroup>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDatasetGroupResponse> instance

Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group contains related
datasets that supply data for training a model. A dataset group can
contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset:

=over

=item *

Interactions

=item *

Items

=item *

Users

=back

To train a model (create a solution), a dataset group that contains an
C<Interactions> dataset is required. Call CreateDataset to add a
dataset to the group.

A dataset group can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING

=back

To get the status of the dataset group, call DescribeDatasetGroup. If
the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a
C<failureReason> key, which describes why the creation failed.

You must wait until the C<status> of the dataset group is C<ACTIVE>
before adding a dataset to the group.

You can specify an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDatasetImportJob>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateDatasetImportJobResponse> instance

Creates a job that imports training data from your data source (an
Amazon S3 bucket) to an Amazon Personalize dataset. To allow Amazon
Personalize to import the training data, you must specify an AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to read
from the data source.

The dataset import job replaces any previous data in the dataset.

B<Status>

A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=back

To get the status of the import job, call DescribeDatasetImportJob,
providing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job. The
dataset import is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the
status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a C<failureReason>
key, which describes why the job failed.

Importing takes time. You must wait until the status shows as ACTIVE
before training a model using the dataset.

=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateEventTracker>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateEventTrackerResponse> instance

Creates an event tracker that you use when sending event data to the
specified dataset group using the PutEvents
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html)
API.

When Amazon Personalize creates an event tracker, it also creates an
I<event-interactions> dataset in the dataset group associated with the
event tracker. The event-interactions dataset stores the event data
from the C<PutEvents> call. The contents of this dataset are not
available to the user.

Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will
get an error if you call C<CreateEventTracker> using the same dataset
group as an existing event tracker.

When you send event data you include your tracking ID. The tracking ID
identifies the customer and authorizes the customer to send the data.

The event tracker can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING E<gt> DELETE IN_PROGRESS

=back

To get the status of the event tracker, call DescribeEventTracker.

The event tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the tracking
ID.

=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::Personalize::CreateSolution>

Returns: a L<Paws::Personalize::CreateSolutionResponse> instance

Creates the configuration for training a model. A trained model is
known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you train the
model (create a solution) by calling the CreateSolutionVersion
operation. Every time you call C<CreateSolutionVersion>, a new version
of the solution is created.

After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling
GetSolutionMetrics. When you are satisfied with the version, you deploy
it using CreateCampaign. The campaign provides recommendations to a
client through the GetRecommendations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html)
API.

To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a
recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide
in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature
transformation. You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided
by Amazon Personalize. Alternatively, you can specify C<performAutoML>
and Amazon Personalize will analyze your data and select the optimum
USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe for you.
