Paws::SSM::OpsItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::OpsItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Category => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::OpsItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Category

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Operations engineers and IT professionals use OpsCenter to view,
investigate, and remediate operational issues impacting the performance
and health of their AWS resources. For more information, see AWS
Systems Manager OpsCenter
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html)
in the I<AWS Systems Manager User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Category => Str

An OpsItem category. Category options include: Availability, Cost,
Performance, Recovery, Security.


=head2 CreatedBy => Str

Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details
about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error
strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data.
You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum
length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys I<can't> begin with the following: amazon, aws,
amzn, ssm, /amazon, /aws, /amzn, /ssm.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that
all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
DescribeOpsItems API action) can view and search on the specified data.
Operational data that is not searchable is only viewable by users who
have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API action).

Use the C</aws/resources> key in OperationalData to specify a related
resource in the request. Use the C</aws/automations> key in
OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
view AWS CLI example commands that use these keys, see Creating
OpsItems Manually
