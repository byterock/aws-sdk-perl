=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::CreateOpsItem - Arguments for method CreateOpsItem on L<Paws::SSM>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateOpsItem on the
L<Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM)|Paws::SSM> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateOpsItem.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateOpsItem.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ssm = Paws->service('SSM');
    my $CreateOpsItemResponse = $ssm->CreateOpsItem(
      Description   => 'MyOpsItemDescription',
      Source        => 'MyOpsItemSource',
      Title         => 'MyOpsItemTitle',
      Category      => 'MyOpsItemCategory',      # OPTIONAL
      Notifications => [
        {
          Arn => 'MyString',                     # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                                         # OPTIONAL
      OperationalData => {
        'MyOpsItemDataKey' => {
          Type =>
            'SearchableString',    # values: SearchableString, String; OPTIONAL
          Value => 'MyOpsItemDataValueString',    # OPTIONAL
        },    # key: min: 1, max: 128
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Priority        => 1,    # OPTIONAL
      RelatedOpsItems => [
        {
          OpsItemId => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL

        },
        ...
      ],                              # OPTIONAL
      Severity => 'MyOpsItemSeverity',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags     => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',            # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',          # min: 1, max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],                                  # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $OpsItemId = $CreateOpsItemResponse->OpsItemId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SSM::CreateOpsItemResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Category => Str

Specify a category to assign to an OpsItem.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

Information about the OpsItem.



=head2 Notifications => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::OpsItemNotification>]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an SNS topic where notifications are
sent when this OpsItem is edited or changed.



=head2 OperationalData => L<Paws::SSM::OpsItemOperationalData>

Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details
about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error
strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data.
You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum
length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys I<can't> begin with the following: amazon, aws,
amzn, ssm, /amazon, /aws, /amzn, /ssm.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that
all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
DescribeOpsItems API action) can view and search on the specified data.
Operational data that is not searchable is only viewable by users who
have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API action).

Use the C</aws/resources> key in OperationalData to specify a related
resource in the request. Use the C</aws/automations> key in
OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
view AWS CLI example commands that use these keys, see Creating
OpsItems Manually
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems)
in the I<AWS Systems Manager User Guide>.



=head2 Priority => Int

The importance of this OpsItem in relation to other OpsItems in the
system.



=head2 RelatedOpsItems => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::RelatedOpsItem>]

One or more OpsItems that share something in common with the current
OpsItems. For example, related OpsItems can include OpsItems with
similar error messages, impacted resources, or statuses for the
impacted resource.



=head2 Severity => Str

Specify a severity to assign to an OpsItem.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Source => Str

The origin of the OpsItem, such as Amazon EC2 or AWS Systems Manager.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Tag>]

Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can restrict
access to OpsItems by using an inline IAM policy that specifies tags.
For more information, see Getting Started with OpsCenter
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-getting-started.html#OpsCenter-getting-started-user-permissions)
in the I<AWS Systems Manager User Guide>.

Tags use a key-value pair. For example:

C<Key=Department,Value=Finance>

To add tags to an existing OpsItem, use the AddTagsToResource action.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Title => Str

A short heading that describes the nature of the OpsItem and the
impacted resource.
