=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducer

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducer object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filter => $value, ..., TemporalFilterSettings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducer object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Enable the Noise reducer (NoiseReducer) feature to remove noise from
your video output if necessary. Enable or disable this feature for each
output individually. This setting is disabled by default. When you
enable Noise reducer (NoiseReducer), you must also select a value for
Noise reducer filter (NoiseReducerFilter).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => Str

Use Noise reducer filter (NoiseReducerFilter) to select one of the
following spatial image filtering functions. To use this setting, you
must also enable Noise reducer (NoiseReducer). * Bilateral preserves
edges while reducing noise. * Mean (softest), Gaussian, Lanczos, and
Sharpen (sharpest) do convolution filtering. * Conserve does min/max
noise reduction. * Spatial does frequency-domain filtering based on JND
principles. * Temporal optimizes video quality for complex motion.


=head2 FilterSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerFilterSettings>

Settings for a noise reducer filter


=head2 SpatialFilterSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerSpatialFilterSettings>

Noise reducer filter settings for spatial filter.


=head2 TemporalFilterSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings>

Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.
