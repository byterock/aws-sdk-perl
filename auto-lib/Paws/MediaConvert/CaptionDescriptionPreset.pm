=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDescriptionPreset

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDescriptionPreset object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomLanguageCode => $value, ..., LanguageDescription => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDescriptionPreset object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomLanguageCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Caption Description for preset

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomLanguageCode => Str

Specify the language for this captions output track. For most captions
output formats, the encoder puts this language information in the
output captions metadata. If your output captions format is DVB-Sub or
Burn in, the encoder uses this language information when automatically
selecting the font script for rendering the captions text. For all
outputs, you can use an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code. For streaming
outputs, you can also use any other code in the full RFC-5646
specification. Streaming outputs are those that are in one of the
following output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO, Apple HLS, or Microsoft Smooth
Streaming.


=head2 DestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDestinationSettings>

Specific settings required by destination type. Note that
burnin_destination_settings are not available if the source of the
caption data is Embedded or Teletext.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

Specify the language of this captions output track. For most captions
output formats, the encoder puts this language information in the
output captions metadata. If your output captions format is DVB-Sub or
Burn in, the encoder uses this language information to choose the font
language for rendering the captions text.


=head2 LanguageDescription => Str

Specify a label for this set of output captions. For example,
"English", "Director commentary", or "track_2". For streaming outputs,
MediaConvert passes this information into destination manifests for
display on the end-viewer's player device. For outputs in other output
groups, the service ignores this setting.
