=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CslgAtom => $value, ..., Mp4MajorBrand => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CslgAtom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for MP4 container. You can create audio-only AAC outputs with
this container.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CslgAtom => Str

When enabled, file composition times will start at zero, composition
times in the 'ctts' (composition time to sample) box for B-frames will
be negative, and a 'cslg' (composition shift least greatest) box will
be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This improves compatibility with
Apple players and tools.


=head2 CttsVersion => Int

Ignore this setting unless compliance to the CTTS box version
specification matters in your workflow. Specify a value of 1 to set
your CTTS box version to 1 and make your output compliant with the
specification. When you specify a value of 1, you must also set CSLG
atom (cslgAtom) to the value INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0 to set
your CTTS box version to 0. This can provide backward compatibility for
some players and packagers.


=head2 FreeSpaceBox => Str

Inserts a free-space box immediately after the moov box.


=head2 MoovPlacement => Str

If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV atom is relocated to the
beginning of the archive as required for progressive downloading.
Otherwise it is placed normally at the end.


=head2 Mp4MajorBrand => Str

Overrides the "Major Brand" field in the output file. Usually not
necessary to specify.
