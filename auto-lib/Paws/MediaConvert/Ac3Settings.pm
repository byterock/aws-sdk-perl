=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::Ac3Settings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::Ac3Settings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bitrate => $value, ..., SampleRate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::Ac3Settings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bitrate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Required when you set (Codec) under
(AudioDescriptions)E<gt>(CodecSettings) to the value AC3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Bitrate => Int

Specify the average bitrate in bits per second. Valid bitrates depend
on the coding mode.


=head2 BitstreamMode => Str

Specify the bitstream mode for the AC-3 stream that the encoder emits.
For more information about the AC3 bitstream mode, see ATSC A/52-2012
(Annex E).


=head2 CodingMode => Str

Dolby Digital coding mode. Determines number of channels.


=head2 Dialnorm => Int

Sets the dialnorm for the output. If blank and input audio is Dolby
Digital, dialnorm will be passed through.


=head2 DynamicRangeCompressionProfile => Str

If set to FILM_STANDARD, adds dynamic range compression signaling to
the output bitstream as defined in the Dolby Digital specification.


=head2 LfeFilter => Str

Applies a 120Hz lowpass filter to the LFE channel prior to encoding.
Only valid with 3_2_LFE coding mode.


=head2 MetadataControl => Str

When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, encoder metadata will be sourced from the DD,
DD+, or DolbyE decoder that supplied this audio data. If audio was not
supplied from one of these streams, then the static metadata settings
will be used.


=head2 SampleRate => Int

This value is always 48000. It represents the sample rate in Hz.
