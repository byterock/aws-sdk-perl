=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::HlsGroupSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::HlsGroupSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalManifests => $value, ..., TimestampDeltaMilliseconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::HlsGroupSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalManifests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Required when you set (Type) under
(OutputGroups)E<gt>(OutputGroupSettings) to HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalManifests => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::HlsAdditionalManifest>]

By default, the service creates one top-level .m3u8 HLS manifest for
each HLS output group in your job. This default manifest references
every output in the output group. To create additional top-level
manifests that reference a subset of the outputs in the output group,
specify a list of them here.


=head2 AdMarkers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Choose one or more ad marker types to decorate your Apple HLS manifest.
This setting does not determine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the
outputs themselves.


=head2 BaseUrl => Str

A partial URI prefix that will be prepended to each output in the media
.m3u8 file. Can be used if base manifest is delivered from a different
URL than the main .m3u8 file.


=head2 CaptionLanguageMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::HlsCaptionLanguageMapping>]

Language to be used on Caption outputs


=head2 CaptionLanguageSetting => Str

Applies only to 608 Embedded output captions. Insert: Include
CLOSED-CAPTIONS lines in the manifest. Specify at least one language in
the CC1 Language Code field. One CLOSED-CAPTION line is added for each
Language Code you specify. Make sure to specify the languages in the
order in which they appear in the original source (if the source is
embedded format) or the order of the caption selectors (if the source
is other than embedded). Otherwise, languages in the manifest will not
match up properly with the output captions. None: Include
CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE line in the manifest. Omit: Omit any
CLOSED-CAPTIONS line from the manifest.


=head2 ClientCache => Str

When set to ENABLED, sets #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag, which prevents
client from saving media segments for later replay.


=head2 CodecSpecification => Str

Specification to use (RFC-6381 or the default RFC-4281) during m3u8
playlist generation.


=head2 Destination => Str

Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3 output location and the
output filename base. Destination accepts format identifiers. If you do
not specify the base filename in the URI, the service will use the
filename of the input file. If your job has multiple inputs, the
service uses the filename of the first input file.


=head2 DestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::DestinationSettings>

Settings associated with the destination. Will vary based on the type
of destination


=head2 DirectoryStructure => Str

Indicates whether segments should be placed in subdirectories.


=head2 Encryption => L<Paws::MediaConvert::HlsEncryptionSettings>

DRM settings.


=head2 ManifestCompression => Str

When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.


=head2 ManifestDurationFormat => Str

Indicates whether the output manifest should use floating point values
for segment duration.


=head2 MinFinalSegmentLength => Num

Keep this setting at the default value of 0, unless you are
troubleshooting a problem with how devices play back the end of your
video asset. If you know that player devices are hanging on the final
segment of your video because the length of your final segment is too
short, use this setting to specify a minimum final segment length, in
seconds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal to 1 and less
than your segment length. When you specify a value for this setting,
the encoder will combine any final segment that is shorter than the
length that you specify with the previous segment. For example, your
segment length is 3 seconds and your final segment is .5 seconds
without a minimum final segment length; when you set the minimum final
segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5 seconds.


=head2 MinSegmentLength => Int

When set, Minimum Segment Size is enforced by looking ahead and back
within the specified range for a nearby avail and extending the segment
size if needed.


=head2 OutputSelection => Str

Indicates whether the .m3u8 manifest file should be generated for this
HLS output group.


=head2 ProgramDateTime => Str

Includes or excludes EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag in .m3u8 manifest
files. The value is calculated as follows: either the program date and
time are initialized using the input timecode source, or the time is
initialized using the input timecode source and the date is initialized
using the timestamp_offset.


=head2 ProgramDateTimePeriod => Int

Period of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME entry, in seconds.


=head2 SegmentControl => Str

When set to SINGLE_FILE, emits program as a single media resource (.ts)
file, uses #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index segment for playback.


=head2 SegmentLength => Int

Length of MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments to create (in seconds). Note
that segments will end on the next keyframe after this number of
seconds, so actual segment length may be longer.


=head2 SegmentsPerSubdirectory => Int

Number of segments to write to a subdirectory before starting a new
one. directoryStructure must be SINGLE_DIRECTORY for this setting to
have an effect.


=head2 StreamInfResolution => Str

Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF
tag of variant manifest.


=head2 TimedMetadataId3Frame => Str

Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.


=head2 TimedMetadataId3Period => Int

Timed Metadata interval in seconds.


=head2 TimestampDeltaMilliseconds => Int

Provides an extra millisecond delta offset to fine tune the timestamps.
