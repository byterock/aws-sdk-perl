=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDestinationSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDestinationSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BurninDestinationSettings => $value, ..., TtmlDestinationSettings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::CaptionDestinationSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BurninDestinationSettings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specific settings required by destination type. Note that
burnin_destination_settings are not available if the source of the
caption data is Embedded or Teletext.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BurninDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::BurninDestinationSettings>

Burn-In Destination Settings.


=head2 DestinationType => Str

Specify the format for this set of captions on this output. The default
format is embedded without SCTE-20. Other options are embedded with
SCTE-20, burn-in, DVB-sub, IMSC, SCC, SRT, teletext, TTML, and web-VTT.
If you are using SCTE-20, choose SCTE-20 plus embedded
(SCTE20_PLUS_EMBEDDED) to create an output that complies with the
SCTE-43 spec. To create a non-compliant output where the embedded
captions come first, choose Embedded plus SCTE-20
(EMBEDDED_PLUS_SCTE20).


=head2 DvbSubDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::DvbSubDestinationSettings>

DVB-Sub Destination Settings


=head2 EmbeddedDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::EmbeddedDestinationSettings>

Settings specific to embedded/ancillary caption outputs, including
608/708 Channel destination number.


=head2 ImscDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::ImscDestinationSettings>

Settings specific to IMSC caption outputs.


=head2 SccDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::SccDestinationSettings>

Settings for SCC caption output.


=head2 TeletextDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::TeletextDestinationSettings>

Settings for Teletext caption output


=head2 TtmlDestinationSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::TtmlDestinationSettings>

Settings specific to TTML caption outputs, including Pass style
information (TtmlStylePassthrough).
