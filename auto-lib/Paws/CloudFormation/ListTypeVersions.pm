=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ListTypeVersions - Arguments for method ListTypeVersions on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListTypeVersions on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListTypeVersions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListTypeVersions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $ListTypeVersionsOutput = $cloudformation->ListTypeVersions(
      Arn              => 'MyPrivateTypeArn',    # OPTIONAL
      DeprecatedStatus => 'LIVE',                # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults       => 1,                     # OPTIONAL
      NextToken        => 'MyNextToken',         # OPTIONAL
      Type             => 'RESOURCE',            # OPTIONAL
      TypeName         => 'MyTypeName',          # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken            = $ListTypeVersionsOutput->NextToken;
    my $TypeVersionSummaries = $ListTypeVersionsOutput->TypeVersionSummaries;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::ListTypeVersionsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/ListTypeVersions>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the type for which you want version
summary information.

Conditional: You must specify either C<TypeName> and C<Type>, or
C<Arn>.



=head2 DeprecatedStatus => Str

The deprecation status of the type versions that you want to get
summary information about.

Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<LIVE>: The type version is registered and can be used in
CloudFormation operations, dependent on its provisioning behavior and
visibility scope.

=item *

C<DEPRECATED>: The type version has been deregistered and can no longer
be used in CloudFormation operations.

=back

The default is C<LIVE>.

Valid values are: C<"LIVE">, C<"DEPRECATED">

=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the
number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes
a C<NextToken> value that you can assign to the C<NextToken> request
parameter to get the next set of results.



=head2 NextToken => Str

If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
results, the response object's C<NextToken> parameter value is set to a
token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and
assign that token to the request object's C<NextToken> parameter. If
there are no remaining results, the previous response object's
C<NextToken> parameter is set to C<null>.



=head2 Type => Str

The kind of the type.

Currently the only valid value is C<RESOURCE>.

Conditional: You must specify either C<TypeName> and C<Type>, or
C<Arn>.

Valid values are: C<"RESOURCE">

=head2 TypeName => Str

The name of the type for which you want version summary information.

Conditional: You must specify either C<TypeName> and C<Type>, or
C<Arn>.
