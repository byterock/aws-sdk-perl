=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Account => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Account

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure that contains summary information about a stack instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Account => Str

[Self-managed permissions] The name of the AWS account that the stack
instance is associated with.


=head2 DriftStatus => Str

Status of the stack instance's actual configuration compared to the
expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set to which
it belongs.

=over

=item *

C<DRIFTED>: The stack differs from the expected template and parameter
configuration of the stack set to which it belongs. A stack instance is
considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the
associated stack have drifted.

=item *

C<NOT_CHECKED>: AWS CloudFormation has not checked if the stack
instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

=item *

C<IN_SYNC>: The stack instance's actual configuration matches its
expected stack set configuration.

=item *

C<UNKNOWN>: This value is reserved for future use.

=back



=head2 LastDriftCheckTimestamp => Str

Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection
operation on the stack instance. This value will be C<NULL> for any
stack instance on which drift detection has not yet been performed.


=head2 OrganizationalUnitId => Str

[C<Service-managed> permissions] The organization root ID or
organizational unit (OU) ID that the stack instance is associated with.


=head2 Region => Str

The name of the AWS region that the stack instance is associated with.


=head2 StackId => Str

The ID of the stack instance.


=head2 StackSetId => Str

The name or unique ID of the stack set that the stack instance is
associated with.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with
its associated stack set.

=over

=item *

C<INOPERABLE>: A C<DeleteStackInstances> operation has failed and left
the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from
further C<UpdateStackSet> operations. You might need to perform a
C<DeleteStackInstances> operation, with C<RetainStacks> set to C<true>,
to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.

=item *

C<OUTDATED>: The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack set
because:

=over

=item *

The associated stack failed during a C<CreateStackSet> or
C<UpdateStackSet> operation.

=item *

The stack was part of a C<CreateStackSet> or C<UpdateStackSet>
operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or
updated.

=back

=item *

C<CURRENT>: The stack is currently up to date with the stack set.

=back



=head2 StatusReason => Str

The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this stack
instance.
