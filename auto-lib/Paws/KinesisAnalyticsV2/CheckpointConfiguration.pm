=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CheckpointingEnabled => $value, ..., MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CheckpointingEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an application's checkpointing configuration. Checkpointing
is the process of persisting application state for fault tolerance. For
more information, see Checkpoints for Fault Tolerance
(https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/concepts/programming-model.html#checkpoints-for-fault-tolerance)
in the Apache Flink Documentation
(https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CheckpointingEnabled => Bool

Describes whether checkpointing is enabled for a Java-based Kinesis
Data Analytics application.

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<CheckpointingEnabled> value of C<true>, even
if this value is set to another value using this API or in application
code.


=head2 CheckpointInterval => Int

Describes the interval in milliseconds between checkpoint operations.

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<CheckpointInterval> vaue of 60000, even if
this value is set to another value using this API or in application
code.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConfigurationType => Str

Describes whether the application uses Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics'
default checkpointing behavior. You must set this property to C<CUSTOM>
in order to set the C<CheckpointingEnabled>, C<CheckpointInterval>, or
C<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints> parameters.

If this value is set to C<DEFAULT>, the application will use the
following values, even if they are set to other values using APIs or
application code:

=over

=item *

B<CheckpointingEnabled:> true

=item *

B<CheckpointInterval:> 60000

=item *

B<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints:> 5000

=back



=head2 MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints => Int

Describes the minimum time in milliseconds after a checkpoint operation
completes that a new checkpoint operation can start. If a checkpoint
operation takes longer than the C<CheckpointInterval>, the application
otherwise performs continual checkpoint operations. For more
information, see Tuning Checkpointing
(https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/ops/state/large_state_tuning.html#tuning-checkpointing)
in the Apache Flink Documentation
(https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/).

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints> value of 5000,
even if this value is set using this API or in application code.
