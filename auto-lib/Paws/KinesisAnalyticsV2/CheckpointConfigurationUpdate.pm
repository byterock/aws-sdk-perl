=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfigurationUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfigurationUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CheckpointingEnabledUpdate => $value, ..., MinPauseBetweenCheckpointsUpdate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::CheckpointConfigurationUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CheckpointingEnabledUpdate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes updates to the checkpointing parameters for a Java-based
Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CheckpointingEnabledUpdate => Bool

Describes updates to whether checkpointing is enabled for an
application.

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<CheckpointingEnabled> value of C<true>, even
if this value is set to another value using this API or in application
code.


=head2 CheckpointIntervalUpdate => Int

Describes updates to the interval in milliseconds between checkpoint
operations.

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<CheckpointInterval> vaue of 60000, even if
this value is set to another value using this API or in application
code.


=head2 ConfigurationTypeUpdate => Str

Describes updates to whether the application uses the default
checkpointing behavior of Kinesis Data Analytics. You must set this
property to C<CUSTOM> in order to set the C<CheckpointingEnabled>,
C<CheckpointInterval>, or C<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints> parameters.

If this value is set to C<DEFAULT>, the application will use the
following values, even if they are set to other values using APIs or
application code:

=over

=item *

B<CheckpointingEnabled:> true

=item *

B<CheckpointInterval:> 60000

=item *

B<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints:> 5000

=back



=head2 MinPauseBetweenCheckpointsUpdate => Int

Describes updates to the minimum time in milliseconds after a
checkpoint operation completes that a new checkpoint operation can
start.

If C<CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType> is C<DEFAULT>, the
application will use a C<MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints> value of 5000,
even if this value is set using this API or in application code.
