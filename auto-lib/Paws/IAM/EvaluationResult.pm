=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::EvaluationResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IAM::EvaluationResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EvalActionName => $value, ..., ResourceSpecificResults => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IAM::EvaluationResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EvalActionName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the results of a simulation.

This data type is used by the return parameter of C<
SimulateCustomPolicy > and C< SimulatePrincipalPolicy >.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EvalActionName => Str

The name of the API operation tested on the indicated resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EvalDecision => Str

The result of the simulation.


=head2 EvalDecisionDetails => L<Paws::IAM::EvalDecisionDetailsType>

Additional details about the results of the cross-account evaluation
decision. This parameter is populated for only cross-account
simulations. It contains a brief summary of how each policy type
contributes to the final evaluation decision.

If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and
includes a resource ARN, then the parameter is present but the response
is empty. If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account
and specifies all resources (C<*>), then the parameter is not returned.

When you make a cross-account request, AWS evaluates the request in the
trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only
if both evaluations return C<true>. For more information about how
policies are evaluated, see Evaluating Policies Within a Single Account
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics).

If an AWS Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access,
the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed
any further and this parameter is not returned.


=head2 EvalResourceName => Str

The ARN of the resource that the indicated API operation was tested on.


=head2 MatchedStatements => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IAM::Statement>]

A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the
result for this scenario. Remember that even if multiple statements
allow the operation on the resource, if only one statement denies that
operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the
deny statement is the only entry included in the result.


=head2 MissingContextValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies
but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is
used when the resource in a simulation is "*", either explicitly, or
when the C<ResourceArns> parameter blank. If you include a list of
resources, then any missing context values are instead included under
the C<ResourceSpecificResults> section. To discover the context keys
used by a set of policies, you can call GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy
or GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy.


=head2 OrganizationsDecisionDetail => L<Paws::IAM::OrganizationsDecisionDetail>

A structure that details how Organizations and its service control
policies affect the results of the simulation. Only applies if the
simulated user's account is part of an organization.


=head2 PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail => L<Paws::IAM::PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail>

Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has
on a policy simulation when the boundary is applied to an IAM entity.


=head2 ResourceSpecificResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IAM::ResourceSpecificResult>]

The individual results of the simulation of the API operation specified
in EvalActionName on each resource.
