=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::AccessDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IAM::AccessDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EntityPath => $value, ..., TotalAuthenticatedEntities => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IAM::AccessDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EntityPath

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that contains details about when a principal in the reported
AWS Organizations entity last attempted to access an AWS service. A
principal can be an IAM user, an IAM role, or the AWS account root user
within the reported Organizations entity.

This data type is a response element in the
GetOrganizationsAccessReport operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EntityPath => Str

The path of the Organizations entity (root, organizational unit, or
account) from which an authenticated principal last attempted to access
the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests.

This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or root
users) in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the
service within the reporting period
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period).


=head2 LastAuthenticatedTime => Str

The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format
(http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601), when an authenticated principal most
recently attempted to access the service. AWS does not report
unauthenticated requests.

This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations
entity attempted to access the service within the reporting period
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period).


=head2 Region => Str

The Region where the last service access attempt occurred.

This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations
entity attempted to access the service within the reporting period
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceName => Str

The name of the service in which access was attempted.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceNamespace => Str

The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

To learn the service namespace of a service, go to Actions, Resources,
and Condition Keys for AWS Services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html)
in the I<IAM User Guide>. Choose the name of the service to view
details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service
prefix. For example, C<(service prefix: a4b)>. For more information
about service namespaces, see AWS Service Namespaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces)
in the I<AWS General Reference>.


=head2 TotalAuthenticatedEntities => Int

The number of accounts with authenticated principals (root users, IAM
users, and IAM roles) that attempted to access the service in the
reporting period.
