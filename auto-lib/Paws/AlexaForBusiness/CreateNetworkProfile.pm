=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateNetworkProfile on the
L<Alexa For Business|Paws::AlexaForBusiness> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateNetworkProfile.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateNetworkProfile.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $a4b = Paws->service('AlexaForBusiness');
    my $CreateNetworkProfileResponse = $a4b->CreateNetworkProfile(
      ClientRequestToken      => 'MyClientRequestToken',
      NetworkProfileName      => 'MyNetworkProfileName',
      SecurityType            => 'OPEN',
      Ssid                    => 'MyNetworkSsid',
      CertificateAuthorityArn => 'MyArn',                          # OPTIONAL
      CurrentPassword         => 'MyCurrentWiFiPassword',          # OPTIONAL
      Description             => 'MyNetworkProfileDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      EapMethod               => 'EAP_TLS',                        # OPTIONAL
      NextPassword            => 'MyNextWiFiPassword',             # OPTIONAL
      TrustAnchors            => [ 'MyTrustAnchor', ... ],         # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NetworkProfileArn = $CreateNetworkProfileResponse->NetworkProfileArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AlexaForBusiness::CreateNetworkProfileResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
