=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::TagResource - Arguments for method TagResource on L<Paws::Glue>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method TagResource on the
L<AWS Glue|Paws::Glue> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method TagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to TagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $glue = Paws->service('Glue');
    my $TagResourceResponse = $glue->TagResource(
      ResourceArn => 'MyGlueResourceArn',
      TagsToAdd   => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
