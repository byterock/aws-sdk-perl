=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::DevEndpointCustomLibraries

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::DevEndpointCustomLibraries object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExtraJarsS3Path => $value, ..., ExtraPythonLibsS3Path => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::DevEndpointCustomLibraries object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExtraJarsS3Path

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Custom libraries to be loaded into a development endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExtraJarsS3Path => Str

The path to one or more Java C<.jar> files in an S3 bucket that should
be loaded in your C<DevEndpoint>.

You can only use pure Java/Scala libraries with a C<DevEndpoint>.


=head2 ExtraPythonLibsS3Path => Str

The paths to one or more Python libraries in an Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) bucket that should be loaded in your
C<DevEndpoint>. Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a
comma.

You can only use pure Python libraries with a C<DevEndpoint>. Libraries
that rely on C extensions, such as the pandas
(http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python data analysis library, are not
currently supported.
