=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::WorkflowGraph

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::WorkflowGraph object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Edges => $value, ..., Nodes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::WorkflowGraph object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Edges

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AWS Glue components present in the workflow and all the directed
connections between them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Edges => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::Edge>]

A list of all the directed connections between the nodes belonging to
the workflow.


=head2 Nodes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::Node>]

A list of the the AWS Glue components belong to the workflow
represented as nodes.



=head1 SEE ALSO
