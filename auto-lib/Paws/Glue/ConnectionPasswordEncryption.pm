=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::ConnectionPasswordEncryption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::ConnectionPasswordEncryption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwsKmsKeyId => $value, ..., ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::ConnectionPasswordEncryption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwsKmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data structure used by the Data Catalog to encrypt the password as
part of C<CreateConnection> or C<UpdateConnection> and store it in the
C<ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD> field in the connection properties. You can
enable catalog encryption or only password encryption.

When a C<CreationConnection> request arrives containing a password, the
Data Catalog first encrypts the password using your AWS KMS key. It
then encrypts the whole connection object again if catalog encryption
is also enabled.

This encryption requires that you set AWS KMS key permissions to enable
or restrict access on the password key according to your security
requirements. For example, you might want only administrators to have
decrypt permission on the password key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AwsKmsKeyId => Str

An AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the connection password.

If connection password protection is enabled, the caller of
C<CreateConnection> and C<UpdateConnection> needs at least
C<kms:Encrypt> permission on the specified AWS KMS key, to encrypt
passwords before storing them in the Data Catalog.

You can set the decrypt permission to enable or restrict access on the
password key according to your security requirements.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted => Bool

When the C<ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted> flag is set to "true",
passwords remain encrypted in the responses of C<GetConnection> and
C<GetConnections>. This encryption takes effect independently from
catalog encryption.
