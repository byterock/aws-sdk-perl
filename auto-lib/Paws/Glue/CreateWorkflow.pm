This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateWorkflow on the
L<AWS Glue|Paws::Glue> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateWorkflow.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateWorkflow.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $glue = Paws->service('Glue');
    my $CreateWorkflowResponse = $glue->CreateWorkflow(
      Name                 => 'MyNameString',
      DefaultRunProperties => {
        'MyIdString' => 'MyGenericString',    # key: min: 1, max: 255
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Description => 'MyGenericString',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags        => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Name = $CreateWorkflowResponse->Name;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Glue::CreateWorkflowResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
