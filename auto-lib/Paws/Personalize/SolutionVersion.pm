=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersion

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersion object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationDateTime => $value, ..., TrainingMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersion object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationDateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that provides information about a specific version of a
Solution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that this version of the solution was
created.


=head2 DatasetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group providing the
training data.


=head2 EventType => Str

The event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') that is used for
training the model.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If training a solution version fails, the reason for the failure.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last updated.


=head2 PerformAutoML => Bool

When true, Amazon Personalize searches for the most optimal recipe
according to the solution configuration. When false (the default),
Amazon Personalize uses C<recipeArn>.


=head2 PerformHPO => Bool

Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the chosen
recipe. The default is C<false>.


=head2 RecipeArn => Str

The ARN of the recipe used in the solution.


=head2 SolutionArn => Str

The ARN of the solution.


=head2 SolutionConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionConfig>

Describes the configuration properties for the solution.


=head2 SolutionVersionArn => Str

The ARN of the solution version.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the solution version.

A solution version can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING

=item *

CREATE IN_PROGRESS

=item *

ACTIVE

=item *

CREATE FAILED

=back



=head2 TrainingHours => Num

The time used to train the model. You are billed for the time it takes
to train a model. This field is visible only after Amazon Personalize
successfully trains a model.


=head2 TrainingMode => Str

The scope of training used to create the solution version. The C<FULL>
option trains the solution version based on the entirety of the input
solution's training data, while the C<UPDATE> option processes only the
training data that has changed since the creation of the last solution
version. Choose C<UPDATE> when you want to start recommending items
added to the dataset without retraining the model.

The C<UPDATE> option can only be used after you've created a solution
version with the C<FULL> option and the training solution uses the
native-recipe-hrnn-coldstart.
