=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::DefaultContinuousHyperParameterRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::DefaultContinuousHyperParameterRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IsTunable => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::DefaultContinuousHyperParameterRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IsTunable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the name and default range of a continuous hyperparameter and
whether the hyperparameter is tunable. A tunable hyperparameter can
have its value determined during hyperparameter optimization (HPO).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsTunable => Bool

Whether the hyperparameter is tunable.


=head2 MaxValue => Num

The maximum allowable value for the hyperparameter.


=head2 MinValue => Num

The minimum allowable value for the hyperparameter.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the hyperparameter.



=head1 SEE ALSO
