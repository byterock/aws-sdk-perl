=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::Solution

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::Solution object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoMLResult => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::Solution object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoMLResult

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that provides information about a solution. A solution is a
trained model that can be deployed as a campaign.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoMLResult => L<Paws::Personalize::AutoMLResult>

When C<performAutoML> is true, specifies the best recipe found.


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The creation date and time (in Unix time) of the solution.


=head2 DatasetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides the
training data.


=head2 EventType => Str

The event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') that is used for
training the model.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last updated.


=head2 LatestSolutionVersion => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersionSummary>

Describes the latest version of the solution, including the status and
the ARN.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the solution.


=head2 PerformAutoML => Bool

When true, Amazon Personalize performs a search for the best
USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe from the list specified in the solution
configuration (C<recipeArn> must not be specified). When false (the
default), Amazon Personalize uses C<recipeArn> for training.


=head2 PerformHPO => Bool

Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the chosen
recipe. The default is C<false>.


=head2 RecipeArn => Str

The ARN of the recipe used to create the solution.


=head2 SolutionArn => Str

The ARN of the solution.


=head2 SolutionConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionConfig>

Describes the configuration properties for the solution.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the solution.

A solution can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING E<gt> DELETE IN_PROGRESS

=back
