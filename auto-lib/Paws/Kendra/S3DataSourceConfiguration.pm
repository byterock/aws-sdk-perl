=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::S3DataSourceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::S3DataSourceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessControlListConfiguration => $value, ..., InclusionPrefixes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::S3DataSourceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessControlListConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides configuration information for a data source to index documents
in an Amazon S3 bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessControlListConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::AccessControlListConfiguration>

Provides the path to the S3 bucket that contains the user context
filtering files for the data source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BucketName => Str

The name of the bucket that contains the documents.


=head2 DocumentsMetadataConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DocumentsMetadataConfiguration>




=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of glob patterns for documents that should not be indexed. If a
document that matches an inclusion prefix also matches an exclusion
pattern, the document is not indexed.

For more information about glob patterns, see glob (programming)
(http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29) in I<Wikipedia>.


=head2 InclusionPrefixes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of S3 prefixes for the documents that should be included in the
