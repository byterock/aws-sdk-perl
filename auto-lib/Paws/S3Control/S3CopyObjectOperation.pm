=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessControlGrants => $value, ..., UnModifiedSinceConstraint => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessControlGrants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the configuration parameters for a PUT Copy object operation.
Amazon S3 batch operations passes each value through to the underlying
PUT Copy object API. For more information about the parameters for this
operation, see PUT Object - Copy
