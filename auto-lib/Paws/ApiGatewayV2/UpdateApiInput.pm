=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGatewayV2::UpdateApiInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApiGatewayV2::UpdateApiInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApiKeySelectionExpression => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApiGatewayV2::UpdateApiInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApiKeySelectionExpression

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the input parameters for an UpdateApi request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApiKeySelectionExpression => Str

An API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket APIs. See
API Key Selection Expressions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-selection-expressions.html#apigateway-websocket-api-apikey-selection-expressions).


=head2 CorsConfiguration => L<Paws::ApiGatewayV2::Cors>

A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.


=head2 CredentialsArn => Str

This property is part of quick create. It specifies the credentials
required for the integration, if any. For a Lambda integration, three
options are available. To specify an IAM Role for API Gateway to
assume, use the role's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To require that the
caller's identity be passed through from the request, specify
arn:aws:iam::*:user/*. To use resource-based permissions on supported
AWS services, specify null. Currently, this property is not used for
HTTP integrations. If provided, this value replaces the credentials
associated with the quick create integration. Supported only for HTTP
APIs.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the API.


=head2 DisableSchemaValidation => Bool

Avoid validating models when creating a deployment. Supported only for
WebSocket APIs.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the API.


=head2 RouteKey => Str

This property is part of quick create. If not specified, the route
created using quick create is kept. Otherwise, this value replaces the
route key of the quick create route. Additional routes may still be
added after the API is updated. Supported only for HTTP APIs.


=head2 RouteSelectionExpression => Str

The route selection expression for the API. For HTTP APIs, the
routeSelectionExpression must be ${request.method} ${request.path}. If
not provided, this will be the default for HTTP APIs. This property is
required for WebSocket APIs.


=head2 Target => Str

This property is part of quick create. For HTTP integrations, specify a
fully qualified URL. For Lambda integrations, specify a function ARN.
The type of the integration will be HTTP_PROXY or AWS_PROXY,
respectively. The value provided updates the integration URI and
integration type. You can update a quick-created target, but you can't
remove it from an API. Supported only for HTTP APIs.


=head2 Version => Str

A version identifier for the API.
