=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::Schedule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::Schedule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CopyTags => $value, ..., VariableTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::Schedule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CopyTags

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a backup schedule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyTags => Bool

Copy all user-defined tags on a source volume to snapshots of the
volume created by this policy.


=head2 CreateRule => L<Paws::DLM::CreateRule>

The creation rule.


=head2 CrossRegionCopyRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRule>]

The rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.


=head2 FastRestoreRule => L<Paws::DLM::FastRestoreRule>

The rule for enabling fast snapshot restore.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the schedule.


=head2 RetainRule => L<Paws::DLM::RetainRule>

The retention rule.


=head2 TagsToAdd => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

The tags to apply to policy-created resources. These user-defined tags
are in addition to the AWS-added lifecycle tags.


=head2 VariableTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

A collection of key/value pairs with values determined dynamically when
the policy is executed. Keys may be any valid Amazon EC2 tag key.
Values must be in one of the two following formats: C<$(instance-id)>
or C<$(timestamp)>. Variable tags are only valid for EBS Snapshot
Management E<ndash> Instance policies.
