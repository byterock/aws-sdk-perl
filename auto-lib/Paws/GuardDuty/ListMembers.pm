=head1 NAME

Paws::GuardDuty::ListMembers - Arguments for method ListMembers on L<Paws::GuardDuty>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListMembers on the
L<Amazon GuardDuty|Paws::GuardDuty> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListMembers.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListMembers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $guardduty = Paws->service('GuardDuty');
    my $ListMembersResponse = $guardduty->ListMembers(
      DetectorId     => 'MyDetectorId',
      MaxResults     => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken      => 'MyString',       # OPTIONAL
      OnlyAssociated => 'MyString',       # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Members   = $ListMembersResponse->Members;
    my $NextToken = $ListMembersResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GuardDuty::ListMembersResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/guardduty/ListMembers>
