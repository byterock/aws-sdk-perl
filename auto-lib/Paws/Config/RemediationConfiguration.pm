=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::RemediationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::RemediationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., TargetVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::RemediationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the details about the remediation
configuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and
data to execute the action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.


=head2 Automatic => Bool

The remediation is triggered automatically.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConfigRuleName => Str

The name of the AWS Config rule.


=head2 CreatedByService => Str

Name of the service that owns the service linked rule, if applicable.


=head2 ExecutionControls => L<Paws::Config::ExecutionControls>

An ExecutionControls object.


=head2 MaximumAutomaticAttempts => Int

The maximum number of failed attempts for auto-remediation. If you do
not select a number, the default is 5.

For example, if you specify MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5 with
RetryAttemptsSeconds as 50 seconds, AWS Config throws an exception
after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::Config::RemediationParameters>

An object of the RemediationParameterValue.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of a resource.


=head2 RetryAttemptSeconds => Int

Maximum time in seconds that AWS Config runs auto-remediation. If you
do not select a number, the default is 60 seconds.

For example, if you specify RetryAttemptsSeconds as 50 seconds and
MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, AWS Config will run auto-remediations 5
times within 50 seconds before throwing an exception.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetId => Str

Target ID is the name of the public document.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetType => Str

The type of the target. Target executes remediation. For example, SSM
document.


=head2 TargetVersion => Str

Version of the target. For example, version of the SSM document.
