=head1 DESCRIPTION

Organization config rule creation or deletion status in each member
account. This includes the name of the rule, the status, error code and

=head2 B<REQUIRED> MemberAccountRuleStatus => Str

time, config rule status is created in the member account. When master
account calls C<PutOrganizationConfigRule> action for the second time,
config rule status is updated in the member account. Config rule status
is deleted when the master account deletes C<OrganizationConfigRule>
and disables service access for
C<config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com>.

AWS Config sets the state of the rule to:
