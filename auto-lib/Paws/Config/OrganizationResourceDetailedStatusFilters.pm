Status filter object to filter results based on specific member account
ID or status type for an organization conformance pack.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The 12-digit account ID of the member account within an organization.


=head2 Status => Str

Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member account.
When master account calls C<PutOrganizationConformancePack> action for
the first time, conformance pack status is created in the member
account. When master account calls C<PutOrganizationConformancePack>
action for the second time, conformance pack status is updated in the
member account. Conformance pack status is deleted when the master
account deletes C<OrganizationConformancePack> and disables service
access for C<config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com>.

AWS Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

=over

C<CREATE_SUCCESSFUL> when conformance pack has been created in the
member account.

=item *

C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS> when conformance pack is being created in the
