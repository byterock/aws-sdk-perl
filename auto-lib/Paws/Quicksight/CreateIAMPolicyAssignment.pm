=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $quicksight = Paws->service('Quicksight');
    my $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse =
      $quicksight->CreateIAMPolicyAssignment(
      AssignmentName   => 'MyIAMPolicyAssignmentName',
      AssignmentStatus => 'ENABLED',
      AwsAccountId     => 'MyAwsAccountId',
      Namespace        => 'MyNamespace',
      Identities       => {
        'MyString' => [
          'MyIdentityName', ...    # min: 1
        ],
      },    # OPTIONAL
      PolicyArn => 'MyArn',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $AssignmentId     = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->AssignmentId;
    my $AssignmentName   = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->AssignmentName;
    my $AssignmentStatus = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->AssignmentStatus;
    my $Identities       = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->Identities;
    my $PolicyArn        = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->PolicyArn;
    my $RequestId        = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->RequestId;
    my $Status           = $CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Quicksight::CreateIAMPolicyAssignmentResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
