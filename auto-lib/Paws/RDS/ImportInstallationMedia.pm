Paws::RDS::ImportInstallationMedia - Arguments for method ImportInstallationMedia on L<Paws::RDS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ImportInstallationMedia on the
L<Amazon Relational Database Service|Paws::RDS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ImportInstallationMedia.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ImportInstallationMedia.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rds = Paws->service('RDS');
    my $InstallationMedia = $rds->ImportInstallationMedia(
      CustomAvailabilityZoneId    => 'MyString',
      Engine                      => 'MyString',
      EngineInstallationMediaPath => 'MyString',
      EngineVersion               => 'MyString',
      OSInstallationMediaPath     => 'MyString',

    );

    # Results:
    my $CustomAvailabilityZoneId = $InstallationMedia->CustomAvailabilityZoneId;
    my $Engine                   = $InstallationMedia->Engine;
    my $EngineInstallationMediaPath =
      $InstallationMedia->EngineInstallationMediaPath;
    my $EngineVersion           = $InstallationMedia->EngineVersion;
    my $FailureCause            = $InstallationMedia->FailureCause;
    my $InstallationMediaId     = $InstallationMedia->InstallationMediaId;
    my $OSInstallationMediaPath = $InstallationMedia->OSInstallationMediaPath;
    my $Status                  = $InstallationMedia->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::RDS::InstallationMedia> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
