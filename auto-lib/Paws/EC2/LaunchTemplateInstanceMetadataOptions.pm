=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::LaunchTemplateInstanceMetadataOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::LaunchTemplateInstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HttpEndpoint => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::LaunchTemplateInstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HttpEndpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HttpEndpoint => Str

This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on your
instances. If the parameter is not specified, the default state is
C<enabled>.

If you specify a value of C<disabled>, you will not be able to access
your instance metadata.


=head2 HttpPutResponseHopLimit => Int

The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests.
The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can
travel.

Default: 1

Possible values: Integers from 1 to 64


=head2 HttpTokens => Str

The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If the
parameter is not specified in the request, the default state is
C<optional>.

If the state is C<optional>, you can choose to retrieve instance
metadata with or without a signed token header on your request. If you
retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role
credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials
using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are
returned.

If the state is C<required>, you must send a signed token header with
any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the
IAM role credentials always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the
version 1.0 credentials are not available.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the metadata option changes.

C<pending> - The metadata options are being updated and the instance is
not ready to process metadata traffic with the new selection.

C<applied> - The metadata options have been successfully applied on the
instance.
