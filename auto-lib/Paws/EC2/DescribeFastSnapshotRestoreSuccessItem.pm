=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::DescribeFastSnapshotRestoreSuccessItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::DescribeFastSnapshotRestoreSuccessItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZone => $value, ..., StateTransitionReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::DescribeFastSnapshotRestoreSuccessItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head2 DisablingTime => Str

The time at which fast snapshot restores entered the C<disabling>
state.


=head2 EnabledTime => Str

The time at which fast snapshot restores entered the C<enabled> state.


=head2 EnablingTime => Str

The time at which fast snapshot restores entered the C<enabling> state.


=head2 OptimizingTime => Str

The time at which fast snapshot restores entered the C<optimizing>
state.


=head2 OwnerAlias => Str

The alias of the snapshot owner.

=head2 StateTransitionReason => Str

The reason for the state transition. The possible values are as
follows:

=over

=item *

C<Client.UserInitiated> - The state successfully transitioned to
C<enabling> or C<disabling>.

=item *
