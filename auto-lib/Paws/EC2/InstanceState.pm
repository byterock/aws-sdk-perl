=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::InstanceState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::InstanceState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::InstanceState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Code => Int

The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals
decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used
for internal purposes and should be ignored.

The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals
decimal values between 0 and 255.

The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of
the low byte and they are:

=over

=item *

C<0> : C<pending>

=item *

C<16> : C<running>

=item *

C<32> : C<shutting-down>

=item *

C<48> : C<terminated>

=item *

C<64> : C<stopping>

=item *

C<80> : C<stopped>

=back

You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above
2^8 or 256 in decimal.


=head2 Name => Str

The current state of the instance.
