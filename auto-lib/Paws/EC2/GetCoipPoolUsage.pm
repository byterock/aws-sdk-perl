=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::GetCoipPoolUsage - Arguments for method GetCoipPoolUsage on L<Paws::EC2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetCoipPoolUsage on the
L<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Paws::EC2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetCoipPoolUsage.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetCoipPoolUsage.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ec2 = Paws->service('EC2');
    my $GetCoipPoolUsageResult = $ec2->GetCoipPoolUsage(
      PoolId  => 'MyCoipPoolId',
      DryRun  => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      Filters => [
        {
          Name   => 'MyString',
          Values => [ 'MyString', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                                    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyString',             # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CoipAddressUsages = $GetCoipPoolUsageResult->CoipAddressUsages;
    my $CoipPoolId        = $GetCoipPoolUsageResult->CoipPoolId;
    my $LocalGatewayRouteTableId =
      $GetCoipPoolUsageResult->LocalGatewayRouteTableId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::EC2::GetCoipPoolUsageResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DryRun => Bool

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
C<DryRunOperation>. Otherwise, it is C<UnauthorizedOperation>.



=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Filter>]

The filters. The following are the possible values:

=over

=item *

C<coip-address-usage.allocation-id>

=back

=over

=item *

C<coip-address-usage.aws-account-id>

=back

=over

=item *

C<coip-address-usage.aws-service>

=back

=over

=item *

C<coip-address-usage.co-ip>

=back




=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve
the remaining results, make another call with the returned C<nextToken>
value.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The token for the next page of results.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PoolId => Str

The ID of the address pool.
