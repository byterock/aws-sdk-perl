  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Services => $value, ..., ThingName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

The destination configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Services => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of service names that identity the target application.
Currently, you can only specify a single name. The AWS IoT client
running on the destination device reads this value and uses it to look
up a port or an IP address and a port. The AWS IoT client instantiates
the local proxy which uses this information to connect to the
destination application.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ThingName => Str

The name of the IoT thing to which you want to connect.
