=head1 NAME

Paws::StepFunctions::CreateActivity - Arguments for method CreateActivity on L<Paws::StepFunctions>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateActivity on the
L<AWS Step Functions|Paws::StepFunctions> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateActivity.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateActivity.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $states = Paws->service('StepFunctions');
    my $CreateActivityOutput = $states->CreateActivity(
      Name => 'MyName',
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128; OPTIONAL
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],                            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ActivityArn  = $CreateActivityOutput->ActivityArn;
    my $CreationDate = $CreateActivityOutput->CreationDate;

    # Returns a L<Paws::StepFunctions::CreateActivityOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
