=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReplicaKmsKeyID => $value, ..., ReplicaKmsKeyID => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReplicaKmsKeyID

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies encryption-related information for an Amazon S3 bucket that
is a destination for replicated objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReplicaKmsKeyID => Str

Specifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed
customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica
objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric customer managed CMKs. For
more information, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
in the I<AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide>.
