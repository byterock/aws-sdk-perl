=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::CreateMultipartUploadOutput

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AbortDate => Str

If the bucket has a lifecycle rule configured with an action to abort
incomplete multipart uploads and the prefix in the lifecycle rule
matches the object name in the request, the response includes this
header. The header indicates when the initiated multipart upload
becomes eligible for an abort operation. For more information, see
Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config).

The response also includes the C<x-amz-abort-rule-id> header that
provides the ID of the lifecycle configuration rule that defines this
action.



=head2 AbortRuleId => Str

This header is returned along with the C<x-amz-abort-date> header. It
identifies the applicable lifecycle configuration rule that defines the
action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.



=head2 Bucket => Str

Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
I<AccessPointName>-I<AccountId>.s3-accesspoint.I<Region>.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide>.



=head2 Key => Str

Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.



=head2 RequestCharged => Str



Valid values are: C<"requester">

=head2 ServerSideEncryption => Str

The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

Valid values are: C<"AES256">, C<"aws:kms">

=head2 SSECustomerAlgorithm => Str

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
requested, the response will include this header confirming the
encryption algorithm used.



=head2 SSECustomerKeyMD5 => Str

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
requested, the response will include this header to provide round-trip
message integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.



=head2 SSEKMSEncryptionContext => Str

If present, specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object
encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string
holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.



=head2 SSEKMSKeyId => Str

If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS
KMS) symmetric customer managed customer master key (CMK) that was used
for the object.



=head2 UploadId => Str

ID for the initiated multipart upload.
