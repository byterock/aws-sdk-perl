=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::ReplicationRuleAndOperator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::ReplicationRuleAndOperator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Prefix => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::ReplicationRuleAndOperator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Prefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the
subset of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required
only if you specify more than one filter.

For example:

=over

=item *

If you specify both a C<Prefix> and a C<Tag> filter, wrap these filters
in an C<And> tag.

=item *

If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the C<Tag>
elements in an C<And> tag
