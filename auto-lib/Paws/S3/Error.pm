=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::Error

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::Error object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::Error object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for all error elements.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Code => Str

The error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error condition.
It is meant to be read and understood by programs that detect and
handle errors by type.

=head2 Key => Str

The error key.


=head2 Message => Str

The error message contains a generic description of the error condition
in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs
display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error
condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated
programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper
internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.


=head2 VersionId => Str

The version ID of the error.
