=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ETag => Str

Entity tag for the uploaded object.



=head2 Expiration => Str

If the expiration is configured for the object (see
PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration), the response includes this header. It
includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs that provide
information about object expiration. The value of the rule-id is URL
encoded.



=head2 RequestCharged => Str



Valid values are: C<"requester">

=head2 ServerSideEncryption => Str

If you specified server-side encryption either with an AWS KMS customer
master key (CMK) or Amazon S3-managed encryption key in your PUT
request, the response includes this header. It confirms the encryption
algorithm that Amazon S3 used to encrypt the object.

Valid values are: C<"AES256">, C<"aws:kms">

=head2 SSECustomerAlgorithm => Str

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
requested, the response will include this header confirming the
encryption algorithm used.



=head2 SSECustomerKeyMD5 => Str

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
requested, the response will include this header to provide round-trip
message integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.



=head2 SSEKMSEncryptionContext => Str

If present, specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object
encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string
holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.



=head2 SSEKMSKeyId => Str

If C<x-amz-server-side-encryption> is present and has the value of
C<aws:kms>, this header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management
Service (AWS KMS) symmetric customer managed customer master key (CMK)
that was used for the object.



=head2 VersionId => Str

Version of the object.
