=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::LifecycleRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::LifecycleRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload => $value, ..., Transitions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::LifecycleRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload => L<Paws::S3::AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload>




=head2 Expiration => L<Paws::S3::LifecycleExpiration>

Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object in the form of
date, days and, whether the object has a delete marker.


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::S3::LifecycleRuleFilter>




=head2 ID => Str

Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255
characters.


=head2 NoncurrentVersionExpiration => L<Paws::S3::NoncurrentVersionExpiration>




=head2 NoncurrentVersionTransitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3::NoncurrentVersionTransition>]

Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that describes
when noncurrent objects transition to a specific storage class. If your
bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set
this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object
versions to a specific storage class at a set period in the object's
lifetime.


=head2 Prefix => Str

Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies. This
is No longer used; use C<Filter> instead.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

If 'Enabled', the rule is currently being applied. If 'Disabled', the
rule is not currently being applied.


=head2 Transitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3::Transition>]

Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified storage
class.
