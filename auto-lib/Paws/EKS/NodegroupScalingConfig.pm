=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::NodegroupScalingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::NodegroupScalingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DesiredSize => $value, ..., MinSize => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::NodegroupScalingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DesiredSize

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the scaling configuration details for the Auto
Scaling group that is associated with your node group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DesiredSize => Int

The current number of worker nodes that the managed node group should

=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum number of worker nodes that the managed node group can
scale out to. Managed node groups can support up to 100 nodes by
default.


=head2 MinSize => Int

The minimum number of worker nodes that the managed node group can
scale in to. This number must be greater than zero.
