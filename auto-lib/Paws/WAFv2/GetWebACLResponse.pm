=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your
get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.


=head2 WebACL => L<Paws::WAFv2::WebACL>

The Web ACL specification. You can modify the settings in this Web ACL
and use it to update this Web ACL or create a new one.
