  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CloudWatchMetricsEnabled => $value, ..., SampledRequestsEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFv2::VisibilityConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CloudWatchMetricsEnabled

This is the latest version of B<AWS WAF>, named AWS WAFV2, released in
November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CloudWatchMetricsEnabled => Bool

A boolean indicating whether the associated resource sends metrics to

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#waf-metrics).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricName => Str

A friendly name of the CloudWatch metric. The name can contain only
alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with length from one to 128
characters. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for

C<MetricName> after you create a C<VisibilityConfig>.

A boolean indicating whether AWS WAF should store a sampling of the web
requests that match the rules. You can view the sampled requests
through the AWS WAF console.
