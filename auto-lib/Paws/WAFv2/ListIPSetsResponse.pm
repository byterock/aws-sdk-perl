=head2 IPSets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFv2::IPSetSummary>]

Array of IPSets. This may not be the full list of IPSets that you have
defined. See the C<Limit> specification for this request.


=head2 NextMarker => Str

When you request a list of objects with a C<Limit> setting, if the
number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
limit, AWS WAF returns a C<NextMarker> value in the response. To
retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior
call in your next request.
