=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFv2::IPSetSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFv2::IPSetSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFv2::IPSetSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the latest version of B<AWS WAF>, named AWS WAFV2, released in
November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF
resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).

High-level information about an IPSet, returned by operations like
create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
use to retrieve and manage an C<IPSet>, and the ARN, that you provide
to the IPSetReferenceStatement to use the address set in a Rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.


=head2 Description => Str

A friendly description of the IP set. You cannot change the description
of an IP set after you create it.


=head2 Id => Str

A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses
to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update
and delete.


=head2 LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your
get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.


=head2 Name => Str

A friendly name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an
C<IPSet> after you create it.
