=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFv2::UpdateIPSet - Arguments for method UpdateIPSet on L<Paws::WAFv2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateIPSet on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFv2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateIPSet.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateIPSet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFv2');
    my $UpdateIPSetResponse = $wafv2->UpdateIPSet(
      Addresses => [
        'MyIPAddress', ...    # min: 1, max: 50
      ],
      Id          => 'MyEntityId',
      LockToken   => 'MyLockToken',
      Name        => 'MyEntityName',
      Scope       => 'CLOUDFRONT',
      Description => 'MyEntityDescription',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextLockToken = $UpdateIPSetResponse->NextLockToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFv2::UpdateIPSetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/wafv2/UpdateIPSet>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Addresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains an array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses or
blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
notation. AWS WAF supports all address ranges for IP versions IPv4 and
IPv6.

Examples:

=over

=item *

To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify C<192.0.2.44/32>.

=item *

To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
C<192.0.2.0/24>.

=item *

To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128>.

=item *

To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64>.

=head2 Description => Str

A friendly description of the IP set. You cannot change the description
of an IP set after you create it.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses
to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update
and delete.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your
get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A friendly name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an
C<IPSet> after you create it.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Scope => Str

Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a
regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load
Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:

=over

=item *

CLI - Specify the region when you use the CloudFront scope:
C<--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1>.

=item *

API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

=back


Valid values are: C<"CLOUDFRONT">, C<"REGIONAL">
