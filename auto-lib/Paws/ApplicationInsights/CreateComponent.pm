Paws::ApplicationInsights::CreateComponent - Arguments for method CreateComponent on L<Paws::ApplicationInsights>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateComponent on the
L<Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights|Paws::ApplicationInsights> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateComponent.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateComponent.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $applicationinsights = Paws->service('ApplicationInsights');

      ComponentName     => 'MyComponentName',
      ResourceGroupName => 'MyResourceGroupName',
      ResourceList      => [
        'MyResourceARN', ...    # min: 1, max: 1011
      ],

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
