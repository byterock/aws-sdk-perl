=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationInsights::ListComponents - Arguments for method ListComponents on L<Paws::ApplicationInsights>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListComponents on the
L<Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights|Paws::ApplicationInsights> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListComponents.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListComponents.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $applicationinsights = Paws->service('ApplicationInsights');
    my $ListComponentsResponse = $applicationinsights->ListComponents(
      ResourceGroupName => 'MyResourceGroupName',
      MaxResults        => 1,                       # OPTIONAL
      NextToken         => 'MyPaginationToken',     # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationComponentList =
      $ListComponentsResponse->ApplicationComponentList;
    my $NextToken = $ListComponentsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ApplicationInsights::ListComponentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/applicationinsights/ListComponents>
