=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::Policy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::Policy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExcludeMap => $value, ..., SecurityServicePolicyData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::Policy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExcludeMap

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An AWS Firewall Manager policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExcludeMap => L<Paws::FMS::CustomerPolicyScopeMap>

Specifies the AWS account IDs to exclude from the policy. The
C<IncludeMap> values are evaluated first, with all the appropriate
account IDs added to the policy. Then the accounts listed in
C<ExcludeMap> are removed, resulting in the final list of accounts to
add to the policy.

The key to the map is C<ACCOUNT>. For example, a valid C<ExcludeMap>
would be C<{E<ldquo>ACCOUNTE<rdquo> : [E<ldquo>accountID1E<rdquo>,
E<ldquo>accountID2E<rdquo>]}>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExcludeResourceTags => Bool

If set to C<True>, resources with the tags that are specified in the
C<ResourceTag> array are not in scope of the policy. If set to
C<False>, and the C<ResourceTag> array is not null, only resources with
the specified tags are in scope of the policy.


=head2 IncludeMap => L<Paws::FMS::CustomerPolicyScopeMap>

Specifies the AWS account IDs to include in the policy. If
C<IncludeMap> is null, all accounts in the organization in AWS
Organizations are included in the policy. If C<IncludeMap> is not null,
only values listed in C<IncludeMap> are included in the policy.

The key to the map is C<ACCOUNT>. For example, a valid C<IncludeMap>
would be C<{E<ldquo>ACCOUNTE<rdquo> : [E<ldquo>accountID1E<rdquo>,
E<ldquo>accountID2E<rdquo>]}>.


=head2 PolicyId => Str

The ID of the AWS Firewall Manager policy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PolicyName => Str

The friendly name of the AWS Firewall Manager policy.


=head2 PolicyUpdateToken => Str

A unique identifier for each update to the policy. When issuing a
C<PutPolicy> request, the C<PolicyUpdateToken> in the request must
match the C<PolicyUpdateToken> of the current policy version. To get
the C<PolicyUpdateToken> of the current policy version, use a
C<GetPolicy> request.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RemediationEnabled => Bool

Indicates if the policy should be automatically applied to new
resources.


=head2 ResourceTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FMS::ResourceTag>]

An array of C<ResourceTag> objects.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceType => Str

The type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy. This is in
the format shown in the AWS Resource Types Reference
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).
For AWS WAF and Shield Advanced, examples include
C<AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer> and
C<AWS::CloudFront::Distribution>. For a security group common policy,
valid values are C<AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface> and
C<AWS::EC2::Instance>. For a security group content audit policy, valid
values are C<AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup>, C<AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface>,
and C<AWS::EC2::Instance>. For a security group usage audit policy, the
value is C<AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup>.


=head2 ResourceTypeList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of C<ResourceType>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityServicePolicyData => L<Paws::FMS::SecurityServicePolicyData>

Details about the security service that is being used to protect the
resources.
