=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::CustomizedMetricSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::CustomizedMetricSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::CustomizedMetricSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a CloudWatch metric of your choosing for a target tracking
scaling policy to use with Application Auto Scaling.

To create your customized metric specification:

=over

=item *

Add values for each required parameter from CloudWatch. You can use an
existing metric, or a new metric that you create. To use your own
metric, you must first publish the metric to CloudWatch. For more
information, see Publish Custom Metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudWatch User Guide>.

=item *

Choose a metric that changes proportionally with capacity. The value of
the metric should increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the
number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should
decrease when capacity increases.

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::MetricDimension>]

The dimensions of the metric.

Conditional: If you published your metric with dimensions, you must
specify the same dimensions in your scaling policy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricName => Str

The name of the metric.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Namespace => Str

The namespace of the metric.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Statistic => Str

The statistic of the metric.


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit of the metric.
