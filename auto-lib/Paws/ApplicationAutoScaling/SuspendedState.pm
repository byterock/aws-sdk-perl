=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::SuspendedState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::SuspendedState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DynamicScalingInSuspended => $value, ..., ScheduledScalingSuspended => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::SuspendedState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DynamicScalingInSuspended

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies whether the scaling activities for a scalable target are in a
suspended state.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DynamicScalingInSuspended => Bool

Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling
policy is suspended. Set the value to C<true> if you don't want
Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a scaling policy is
triggered. The default is C<false>.


=head2 DynamicScalingOutSuspended => Bool

Whether scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling
policy is suspended. Set the value to C<true> if you don't want
Application Auto Scaling to add capacity when a scaling policy is
triggered. The default is C<false>.


=head2 ScheduledScalingSuspended => Bool

Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to C<true> if you
don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capacity by
initiating scheduled actions. The default is C<false>.
