=head1 NAME

Paws::AppConfig::CreateDeploymentStrategy - Arguments for method CreateDeploymentStrategy on L<Paws::AppConfig>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDeploymentStrategy on the
L<Amazon AppConfig|Paws::AppConfig> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDeploymentStrategy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDeploymentStrategy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appconfig = Paws->service('AppConfig');
    my $DeploymentStrategy = $appconfig->CreateDeploymentStrategy(
      DeploymentDurationInMinutes => 1,
      GrowthFactor                => 1.0,
      Name                        => 'MyName',
      ReplicateTo                 => 'NONE',
      Description                 => 'MyDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      FinalBakeTimeInMinutes      => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      GrowthType                  => 'LINEAR',           # OPTIONAL
      Tags                        => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DeploymentDurationInMinutes =
      $DeploymentStrategy->DeploymentDurationInMinutes;
    my $Description            = $DeploymentStrategy->Description;
    my $FinalBakeTimeInMinutes = $DeploymentStrategy->FinalBakeTimeInMinutes;
    my $GrowthFactor           = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthFactor;
    my $GrowthType             = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthType;
    my $Id                     = $DeploymentStrategy->Id;
    my $Name                   = $DeploymentStrategy->Name;
    my $ReplicateTo            = $DeploymentStrategy->ReplicateTo;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppConfig::DeploymentStrategy> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentDurationInMinutes => Int

Total amount of time for a deployment to last.



=head2 Description => Str

A description of the deployment strategy.



=head2 FinalBakeTimeInMinutes => Int

The amount of time AppConfig monitors for alarms before considering the
deployment to be complete and no longer eligible for automatic roll
back.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> GrowthFactor => Num

The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
each interval.



=head2 GrowthType => Str

The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time.

Valid values are: C<"LINEAR">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A name for the deployment strategy.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReplicateTo => Str

Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.

Valid values are: C<"NONE">, C<"SSM_DOCUMENT">

=head2 Tags => L<Paws::AppConfig::TagMap>

Metadata to assign to the deployment strategy. Tags help organize and
categorize your AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.
