=head1 NAME

Paws::AppConfig::StopDeployment - Arguments for method StopDeployment on L<Paws::AppConfig>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StopDeployment on the
L<Amazon AppConfig|Paws::AppConfig> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StopDeployment.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StopDeployment.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appconfig = Paws->service('AppConfig');
    my $Deployment = $appconfig->StopDeployment(
      ApplicationId    => 'MyId',
      DeploymentNumber => 1,
      EnvironmentId    => 'MyId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationId               = $Deployment->ApplicationId;
    my $CompletedAt                 = $Deployment->CompletedAt;
    my $ConfigurationLocationUri    = $Deployment->ConfigurationLocationUri;
    my $ConfigurationName           = $Deployment->ConfigurationName;
    my $ConfigurationProfileId      = $Deployment->ConfigurationProfileId;
    my $ConfigurationVersion        = $Deployment->ConfigurationVersion;
    my $DeploymentDurationInMinutes = $Deployment->DeploymentDurationInMinutes;
    my $DeploymentNumber            = $Deployment->DeploymentNumber;
    my $DeploymentStrategyId        = $Deployment->DeploymentStrategyId;
    my $Description                 = $Deployment->Description;
    my $EnvironmentId               = $Deployment->EnvironmentId;
    my $FinalBakeTimeInMinutes      = $Deployment->FinalBakeTimeInMinutes;
    my $GrowthFactor                = $Deployment->GrowthFactor;
    my $GrowthType                  = $Deployment->GrowthType;
    my $PercentageComplete          = $Deployment->PercentageComplete;
    my $StartedAt                   = $Deployment->StartedAt;
    my $State                       = $Deployment->State;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppConfig::Deployment> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
