=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ProcessingClusterConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ProcessingClusterConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceCount => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ProcessingClusterConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for the cluster used to run a processing job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceCount => Int

The number of ML compute instances to use in the processing job. For
distributed processing jobs, specify a value greater than 1. The
default value is 1.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The ML compute instance type for the processing job.


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses
to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute
instance(s) that run the processing job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The size of the ML storage volume in gigabytes that you want to
provision. You must specify sufficient ML storage for your scenario.
