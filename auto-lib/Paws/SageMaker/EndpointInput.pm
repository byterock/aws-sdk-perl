=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::EndpointInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::EndpointInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointName => $value, ..., S3InputMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::EndpointInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Input object for the endpoint

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndpointName => Str

An endpoint in customer's account which has enabled
C<DataCaptureConfig> enabled.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LocalPath => Str

Path to the filesystem where the endpoint data is available to the
container.


=head2 S3DataDistributionType => Str

Whether input data distributed in Amazon S3 is fully replicated or
sharded by an S3 key. Defauts to C<FullyReplicated>


=head2 S3InputMode => Str

Whether the C<Pipe> or C<File> is used as the input mode for
transfering data for the monitoring job. C<Pipe> mode is recommended
for large datasets. C<File> mode is useful for small files that fit in
memory. Defaults to C<File>.
