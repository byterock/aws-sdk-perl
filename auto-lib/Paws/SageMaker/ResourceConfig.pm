=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceCount => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the resources, including ML compute instances and ML storage
volumes, to use for model training.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceCount => Int

The number of ML compute instances to use. For distributed training,
provide a value greater than 1.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The ML compute instance type.


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The AWS KMS key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the
storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the
training job.

Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on the
instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware
module on the instance. You can't request a C<VolumeKmsKeyId> when
using an instance type with local storage.

For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, see
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).

For more information about local instance storage encryption, see SSD
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html).

The C<VolumeKmsKeyId> can be in any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision.

ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
Training algorithms might also use the ML storage volume for scratch
space. If you want to store the training data in the ML storage volume,
choose C<File> as the C<TrainingInputMode> in the algorithm
specification.

You must specify sufficient ML storage for your scenario.

Amazon SageMaker supports only the General Purpose SSD (gp2) ML storage
volume type.

Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage with a fixed total
size, dependent on the instance type. When using these instances for
training, Amazon SageMaker mounts the local instance storage instead of
Amazon EBS gp2 storage. You can't request a C<VolumeSizeInGB> greater
than the total size of the local instance storage.

For a list of instance types that support local instance storage,
including the total size per instance type, see Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).
