=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::IntegerParameterRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::IntegerParameterRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxValue => $value, ..., ScalingType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::IntegerParameterRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxValue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For a hyperparameter of the integer type, specifies the range that a
hyperparameter tuning job searches.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxValue => Str

The maximum value of the hyperparameter to search.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinValue => Str

The minimum value of the hyperparameter to search.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the hyperparameter to search.


=head2 ScalingType => Str

The scale that hyperparameter tuning uses to search the hyperparameter
range. For information about choosing a hyperparameter scale, see
Hyperparameter Scaling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-define-ranges.html#scaling-type).
One of the following values:

=over

=item Auto

Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning chooses the best scale for the
hyperparameter.

=item Linear

Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range
by using a linear scale.

=item Logarithmic

Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range
by using a logarithmic scale.

Logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that have only values greater
than 0.
