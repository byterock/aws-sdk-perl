=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::DeleteDomain - Arguments for method DeleteDomain on L<Paws::SageMaker>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteDomain on the
L<Amazon SageMaker Service|Paws::SageMaker> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteDomain.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteDomain.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    $api . sagemaker->DeleteDomain(
      DomainId        => 'MyDomainId',
      RetentionPolicy => {
        HomeEfsFileSystem => 'Retain',    # values: Retain, Delete; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
