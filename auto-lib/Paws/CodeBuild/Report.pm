=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::Report

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::Report object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::Report object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the results from running a series of test cases
during the run of a build project. The test cases are specified in the
buildspec for the build project using one or more paths to the test
case files. You can specify any type of tests you want, such as unit
tests, integration tests, and functional tests.
