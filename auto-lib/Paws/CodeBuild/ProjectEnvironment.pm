=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::ProjectEnvironment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::ProjectEnvironment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Certificate => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::ProjectEnvironment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Certificate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the build environment of the build project.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Certificate => Str

The certificate to use with this build project.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComputeType => Str

Information about the compute resources the build project uses.
Available values include:

=over

=item *

C<BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL>: Use up to 3 GB memory and 2 vCPUs for builds.

=item *

C<BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM>: Use up to 7 GB memory and 4 vCPUs for builds.

=item *

C<BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE>: Use up to 16 GB memory and 8 vCPUs for builds,
depending on your environment type.

=item *

C<BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE>: Use up to 145 GB memory, 72 vCPUs, and 824
GB of SSD storage for builds. This compute type supports Docker images
up to 100 GB uncompressed.

=back

If you use C<BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE>:

=over

=item *

For environment type C<LINUX_CONTAINER>, you can use up to 15 GB memory
and 8 vCPUs for builds.

=item *

For environment type C<LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER>, you can use up to 255 GB
memory, 32 vCPUs, and 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for builds.

=item *

For environment type C<ARM_CONTAINER>, you can use up to 16 GB memory
and 8 vCPUs on ARM-based processors for builds.

=back

For more information, see Build Environment Compute Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html)
in the I<AWS CodeBuild User Guide.>


=head2 EnvironmentVariables => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodeBuild::EnvironmentVariable>]

A set of environment variables to make available to builds for this
build project.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Image => Str

The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use
for this build project. Use the following formats:

=over

=item *

For an image tag: C<registry/repository:tag>. For example, to specify
an image with the tag "latest," use C<registry/repository:latest>.

=item *

For an image digest: C<registry/repository@digest>. For example, to
specify an image with the digest
"sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf,"
use
C<registry/repository@sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cfbdbf>.

=back



=head2 ImagePullCredentialsType => Str

The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
build. There are two valid values:

=over

=item *

C<CODEBUILD> specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials.
This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS
CodeBuild's service principal.

=item *

C<SERVICE_ROLE> specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's
service role.

=back

When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use
SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image,
you must use CODEBUILD credentials.


=head2 PrivilegedMode => Bool

Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to
true only if the build project is used to build Docker images.
Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon
fails. The default setting is C<false>.

You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your
build by adding one of the following sets of commands to the install
phase of your buildspec file:

If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

C<- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&>

C<- timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done">

If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the previous
command does not work, add the C<-t> argument to C<timeout>:

C<- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&>

C<- timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done">


=head2 RegistryCredential => L<Paws::CodeBuild::RegistryCredential>

The credentials for access to a private registry.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str
