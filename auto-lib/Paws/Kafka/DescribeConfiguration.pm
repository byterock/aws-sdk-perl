=head1 NAME

Paws::Kafka::DescribeConfiguration - Arguments for method DescribeConfiguration on L<Paws::Kafka>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeConfiguration on the
L<Managed Streaming for Kafka|Paws::Kafka> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeConfiguration.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeConfiguration.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $kafka = Paws->service('Kafka');
    my $DescribeConfigurationResponse = $kafka->DescribeConfiguration(
      Arn => 'My__string',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Arn            = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->Arn;
    my $CreationTime   = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->CreationTime;
    my $Description    = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->Description;
    my $KafkaVersions  = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->KafkaVersions;
    my $LatestRevision = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->LatestRevision;
    my $Name           = $DescribeConfigurationResponse->Name;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Kafka::DescribeConfigurationResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
