=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::RoutingStrategy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::RoutingStrategy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FleetId => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::RoutingStrategy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FleetId

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FleetId => Str

The unique identifier for a fleet that the alias points to. This value
is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.


=head2 Message => Str

The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of routing strategy for the alias.

Possible routing types include the following:

=over

=item *

B<SIMPLE> - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type
when routing to active fleets.

=item *

B<TERMINAL> - The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead can be
used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws a
TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the RoutingStrategy message
embedded.
