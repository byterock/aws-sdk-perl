Paws::GameLift::ListTagsForResource - Arguments for method ListTagsForResource on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListTagsForResource on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListTagsForResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListTagsForResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $ListTagsForResourceResponse = $gamelift->ListTagsForResource(
      ResourceARN => 'MyAmazonResourceName',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Tags = $ListTagsForResourceResponse->Tags;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::ListTagsForResourceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
