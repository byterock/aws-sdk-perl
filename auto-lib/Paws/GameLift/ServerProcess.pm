=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConcurrentExecutions => $value, ..., Parameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConcurrentExecutions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of instructions for launching server processes on each instance
in a fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable
or a Realtime Servers script. Each instruction set identifies the
location of the custom game build executable or Realtime launch script,
optional launch parameters, and the number of server processes with
this configuration to maintain concurrently on the instance. Server
process configurations make up a fleet's C< RuntimeConfiguration >.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConcurrentExecutions => Int

The number of server processes that use this configuration to run
concurrently on an instance.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LaunchPath => Str

The location of the server executable in a custom game build or the
name of the Realtime script file that contains the C<Init()> function.
Game builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at the
root:

=over

=item *

Windows (for custom game builds only): C<C:\game>. Example:
"C<C:\game\MyGame\server.exe>"

=item *

Linux: C</local/game>. Examples: "C</local/game/MyGame/server.exe>" or
"C</local/game/MyRealtimeScript.js>"

=back



=head2 Parameters => Str

An optional list of parameters to pass to the server executable or
Realtime script on launch.
