=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::CreateScript - Arguments for method CreateScript on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateScript on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateScript.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateScript.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $CreateScriptOutput = $gamelift->CreateScript(
      Name            => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
      StorageLocation => {
        Bucket        => 'MyNonEmptyString',         # min: 1; OPTIONAL
        Key           => 'MyNonEmptyString',         # min: 1; OPTIONAL
        ObjectVersion => 'MyNonEmptyString',         # min: 1; OPTIONAL
        RoleArn       => 'MyNonEmptyString',         # min: 1; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],                            # OPTIONAL
      Version => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
      ZipFile => 'BlobZipBlob',              # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Script = $CreateScriptOutput->Script;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::CreateScriptOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/gamelift/CreateScript>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do
not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value
later.



=head2 StorageLocation => L<Paws::GameLift::S3Location>

The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing
your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the
Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN
that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location.
The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new
script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the
zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the
C<ObjectVersion> parameter to specify an earlier version.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::Tag>]

A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are
developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for
resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more
information, see Tagging AWS Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the
I<AWS General Reference>. Once the resource is created, you can use
TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and
view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS
General Reference for actual tagging limits.



=head2 Version => Str

The version that is associated with a build or script. Version strings
do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value
later.



=head2 ZipFile => Str

A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of
a zip file is 5 MB.

When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set
to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://"
to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example:
C<--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip>.
