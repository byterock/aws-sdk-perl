=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::EntityTypesEvaluationMetrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::EntityTypesEvaluationMetrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { F1Score => $value, ..., Recall => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::EntityTypesEvaluationMetrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->F1Score

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Detailed information about the accuracy of an entity recognizer for a
specific entity type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 F1Score => Num

A measure of how accurate the recognizer results are for for a specific
entity type in the test data. It is derived from the C<Precision> and
C<Recall> values. The C<F1Score> is the harmonic average of the two
scores. The highest score is 1, and the worst score is 0.


=head2 Precision => Num

A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results for a specific
entity type in the test data. High precision means that the recognizer
returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones.


=head2 Recall => Num

A measure of how complete the recognizer results are for a specific
entity type in the test data. High recall means that the recognizer
returned most of the relevant results.
