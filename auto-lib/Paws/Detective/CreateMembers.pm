=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.detective = Paws->service('Detective');
    my $CreateMembersResponse = $api . detective->CreateMembers(
      Accounts => [
        {
          AccountId    => 'MyAccountId',       # min: 12, max: 12
          EmailAddress => 'MyEmailAddress',    # min: 1, max: 64

      ],
      GraphArn => 'MyGraphArn',
      Message  => 'MyEmailMessage',            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Members             = $CreateMembersResponse->Members;
    my $UnprocessedAccounts = $CreateMembersResponse->UnprocessedAccounts;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Detective::CreateMembersResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
