=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LastGeneratedReportDate => $value, ..., SubscriptionErrors => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppStream::UsageReportSubscription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LastGeneratedReportDate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes information about the usage report subscription.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LastGeneratedReportDate => Str

The time when the last usage report was generated.


=head2 S3BucketName => Str

The Amazon S3 bucket where generated reports are stored.

If you enabled on-instance session scripts and Amazon S3 logging for
your session script configuration, AppStream 2.0 created an S3 bucket
to store the script output. The bucket is unique to your account and
Region. When you enable usage reporting in this case, AppStream 2.0
uses the same bucket to store your usage reports. If you haven't
already enabled on-instance session scripts, when you enable usage
reports, AppStream 2.0 creates a new S3 bucket.


=head2 Schedule => Str

The schedule for generating usage reports.


=head2 SubscriptionErrors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppStream::LastReportGenerationExecutionError>]

The errors that were returned if usage reports couldn't be generated.
