=head1 NAME

Paws::AppStream::ImageBuilder

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppStream::ImageBuilder object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessEndpoints => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppStream::ImageBuilder object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessEndpoints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a virtual machine that is used to create an image.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessEndpoints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppStream::AccessEndpoint>]

The list of virtual private cloud (VPC) interface endpoint objects.
Administrators can connect to the image builder only through the
specified endpoints.


=head2 AppstreamAgentVersion => Str

The version of the AppStream 2.0 agent that is currently being used by
the image builder.


=head2 Arn => Str

The ARN for the image builder.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The time stamp when the image builder was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description to display.


=head2 DisplayName => Str

The image builder name to display.


=head2 DomainJoinInfo => L<Paws::AppStream::DomainJoinInfo>

The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join
the image builder to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.


=head2 EnableDefaultInternetAccess => Bool

Enables or disables default internet access for the image builder.


=head2 IamRoleArn => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the image builder. To assume
a role, the image builder calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS)
C<AssumeRole> API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The
operation creates a new session with temporary credentials. AppStream
2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the
B<AppStream_Machine_Role> credential profile on the instance.

For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming Instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/using-iam-roles-to-grant-permissions-to-applications-scripts-streaming-instances.html)
in the I<Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide>.


=head2 ImageArn => Str

The ARN of the image from which this builder was created.


=head2 ImageBuilderErrors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppStream::ResourceError>]

The image builder errors.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type for the image builder. The following instance types
are available:
