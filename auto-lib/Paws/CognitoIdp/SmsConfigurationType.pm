  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExternalId => $value, ..., SnsCallerArn => $value  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SMS configuration type that includes the settings the Cognito User
Pool needs to call for the Amazon SNS service to send an SMS message
from your AWS account. The Cognito User Pool makes the request to the
Amazon SNS Service by using an AWS IAM role that you provide for your
AWS account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExternalId => Str

The external ID is a value that we recommend you use to add security to
your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for
your user pool. If you provide an C<ExternalId>, the Cognito User Pool
will include it when attempting to assume your IAM role, so that you
can set your roles trust policy to require the C<ExternalID>. If you
use the Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA,
Cognito will create a role with the required permissions and a trust
policy that demonstrates use of the C<ExternalId>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SnsCallerArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
Service (SNS) caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in your AWS
account which Cognito will use to send SMS messages.
