=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::CustomerManagedDatastoreS3Storage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::CustomerManagedDatastoreS3Storage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this to store data store data in an S3 bucket that you manage. When
customer managed storage is selected, the "retentionPeriod" parameter
is ignored. The choice of service-managed or customer-managed S3
storage cannot be changed after creation of the data store.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str
