=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTAnalytics::S3DestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::S3DestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::S3DestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration information for delivery of data set contents to Amazon
S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which data set contents are
delivered.


=head2 GlueConfiguration => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::GlueConfiguration>

Configuration information for coordination with the AWS Glue ETL
(extract, transform and load) service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The key of the data set contents object. Each object in an Amazon S3
bucket has a key that is its unique identifier within the bucket (each
object in a bucket has exactly one key). To produce a unique key, you
can use "!{iotanalytics:scheduledTime}" to insert the time of the
scheduled SQL query run, or "!{iotanalytics:versioned} to insert a
unique hash identifying the data set, for example:
"/DataSet/!{iotanalytics:scheduledTime}/!{iotanalytics:versioned}.csv".


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The ARN of the role which grants AWS IoT Analytics permission to
interact with your Amazon S3 and AWS Glue resources.
