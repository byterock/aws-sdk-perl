=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::WindowsFileSystemConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::WindowsFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveDirectoryId => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::WindowsFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveDirectoryId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for this Microsoft Windows file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveDirectoryId => Str

The ID for an existing Microsoft Active Directory instance that the
file system should join when it's created.


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int

The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0
disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a
maximum of 35 days.


=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be
copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true,
all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any
user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this
value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified
tags are copied to backups.


=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str

The preferred time to take daily automatic backups, in the UTC time
zone.


=head2 DeploymentType => Str

Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are the
following:

=over

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_1> - Specifies a high availability file system that is
configured for Multi-AZ redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability
Zone (AZ) unavailability.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_1> - (Default) Specifies a file system that is configured
for single AZ redundancy.

=back



=head2 MaintenanceOperationsInProgress => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of maintenance operations in progress for this file system.


=head2 PreferredFileServerIp => Str

For C<MULTI_AZ_1> deployment types, the IP address of the primary, or
preferred, file server.

Use this IP address when mounting the file system on Linux SMB clients
or Windows SMB clients that are not joined to a Microsoft Active
Directory. Applicable for both C<SINGLE_AZ_1> and C<MULTI_AZ_1>
deployment types. This IP address is temporarily unavailable when the
file system is undergoing maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB
clients that are joined to an Active Directory, use the file system's
DNSName instead. For more information and instruction on mapping and
mounting file shares, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/accessing-file-shares.html
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/accessing-file-shares.html).


=head2 PreferredSubnetId => Str

For C<MULTI_AZ_1> deployment types, it specifies the ID of the subnet
where the preferred file server is located. Must be one of the two
subnet IDs specified in C<SubnetIds> property. Amazon FSx serves
traffic from this subnet except in the event of a failover to the
secondary file server.

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1> deployment types, this value is the same as that for
C<SubnetIDs>.


=head2 RemoteAdministrationEndpoint => Str

For C<MULTI_AZ_1> deployment types, use this endpoint when performing
administrative tasks on the file system using Amazon FSx Remote
PowerShell.

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1> deployment types, this is the DNS name of the file
system.

This endpoint is temporarily unavailable when the file system is
undergoing maintenance.


=head2 SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::SelfManagedActiveDirectoryAttributes>




=head2 ThroughputCapacity => Int

The throughput of an Amazon FSx file system, measured in megabytes per
second.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str

The preferred time to perform weekly maintenance, in the UTC time zone.
