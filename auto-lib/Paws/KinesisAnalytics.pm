Adds a streaming source to your Amazon Kinesis application. For
conceptual information, see Configuring Application Input
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-input.html).

You can add a streaming source either when you create an application or
you can use this operation to add a streaming source after you create
an application. For more information, see CreateApplication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_CreateApplication.html).

Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using
this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can
use the DescribeApplication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html)
operation to find the current application version.

This operation requires permissions to perform the
C<kinesisanalytics:AddApplicationInput> action.


=head2 AddApplicationInputProcessingConfiguration

=over

=item ApplicationName => Str

=item CurrentApplicationVersionId => Int

=item InputId => Str

=item InputProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::InputProcessingConfiguration>


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::AddApplicationInputProcessingConfiguration>

Returns: a L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::AddApplicationInputProcessingConfigurationResponse> instance

This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data
Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the
API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about
version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.

Adds an InputProcessingConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_InputProcessingConfiguration.html)
to an application. An input processor preprocesses records on the input
stream before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the only
input processor available is AWS Lambda
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data
Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the
API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about
version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.

Adds an external destination to your Amazon Kinesis Analytics
application.

If you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an
in-application stream within your application to an external
destination (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon Kinesis
Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function), you add the
relevant configuration to your application using this operation. You
can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output
configuration maps an in-application stream and an external
destination.

You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your
in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can
analyze the errors. For more information, see Understanding Application
Output (Destination)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-output.html).

Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using
this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can
use the DescribeApplication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html)
operation to find the current application version.

For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can
configure, see Limits
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/limits.html).

This operation requires permissions to perform the
C<kinesisanalytics:AddApplicationOutput> action.


=head2 AddApplicationReferenceDataSource

=over

=item ApplicationName => Str

=item CurrentApplicationVersionId => Int

=item ReferenceDataSource => L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::ReferenceDataSource>


=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::AddApplicationReferenceDataSource>

Returns: a L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::AddApplicationReferenceDataSourceResponse> instance

This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data
Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the
API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about
version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.

Adds a reference data source to an existing application.

Amazon Kinesis Analytics reads reference data (that is, an Amazon S3
object) and creates an in-application table within your application. In
the request, you provide the source (S3 bucket name and object key
name), name of the in-application table to create, and the necessary
mapping information that describes how data in Amazon S3 object maps to
columns in the resulting in-application table.

For conceptual information, see Configuring Application Input
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-input.html).
For the limits on data sources you can add to your application, see
Limits
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/limits.html).

This operation requires permissions to perform the
C<kinesisanalytics:AddApplicationOutput> action.

=back

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::CreateApplication>

Returns: a L<Paws::KinesisAnalytics::CreateApplicationResponse> instance

This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data
Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the
API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about
version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.

Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each
application with one streaming source as input, application code to
process the input, and up to three destinations where you want Amazon
Kinesis Analytics to write the output data from your application. For
an overview, see How it Works
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works.html).

In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an
in-application stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating
table. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for the in-application
stream and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data
element in the streaming source.

Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input
data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can
create one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps.

In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write
data from in-application streams created in your applications to up to
three destinations.

To read data from your source stream or write data to destination
streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics needs your permissions. You grant
these permissions by creating IAM roles. This operation requires
permissions to perform the C<kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication>
action.

For introductory exercises to create an Amazon Kinesis Analytics
application, see Getting Started
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/getting-started.html).
