  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdDecisionServerUrl => $value, ..., MaxDurationSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::LivePreRollConfiguration object:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdDecisionServerUrl => Str

The URL for the ad decision server (ADS) for pre-roll ads. This
includes the specification of static parameters and placeholders for
dynamic parameters. AWS Elemental MediaTailor substitutes
player-specific and session-specific parameters as needed when calling
the ADS. Alternately, for testing, you can provide a static VAST URL.
The maximum length is 25,000 characters.


=head2 MaxDurationSeconds => Int

The maximum allowed duration for the pre-roll ad avail. AWS Elemental
MediaTailor won't play pre-roll ads to exceed this duration, regardless
of the total duration of ads that the ADS returns.
