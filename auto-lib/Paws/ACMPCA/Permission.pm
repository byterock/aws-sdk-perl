  $result->Att1->Actions

Permissions designate which private CA actions can be performed by an
AWS service or entity. In order for ACM to automatically renew private
certificates, you must give the ACM service principal all available
permissions (C<IssueCertificate>, C<GetCertificate>, and
C<ListPermissions>). Permissions can be assigned with the
CreatePermission action, removed with the DeletePermission action, and
listed with the ListPermissions action.
