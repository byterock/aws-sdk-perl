=head1 NAME

Paws::ACMPCA::CreatePermission - Arguments for method CreatePermission on L<Paws::ACMPCA>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreatePermission on the
L<AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority|Paws::ACMPCA> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreatePermission.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreatePermission.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $acm-pca = Paws->service('ACMPCA');
    $acm -pca->CreatePermission(
      Actions => [
        'IssueCertificate',
        ...    # values: IssueCertificate, GetCertificate, ListPermissions
      ],
      CertificateAuthorityArn => 'MyArn',
      Principal               => 'MyPrincipal',
      SourceAccount           => 'MyAccountId',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/acm-pca/CreatePermission>
